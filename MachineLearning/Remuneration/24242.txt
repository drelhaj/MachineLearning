Introduction
The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors' Remuneration (the Committee ) 
within a framework set by the Board. As at the date of this report, the Committee's members are three non-executive directors, Mr Toms 
(Chairman), Mr Johnson and Mr Cuthbert. Mr Perry was a member of the Committee until his retirement at the AGM on 15 January 2010, 
when his place on the Committee was taken by Mr Cuthbert. None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than 
as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement 
in running the business. The Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on the Company's website.
During the year, the Group Company Secretary attended a number of Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee and 
provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration. The Committee also received independent external advice 
from Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS ). HNBS was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other services to the 
Company other than to the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors (apart from the Chairman) is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive 
Directors' Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors. The Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration  
also receives advice from the Group Company Secretary and HNBS.
The Chairman's remuneration is determined by the other non-executive directors.
Objectives
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and 
motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers. 
The Committee has set, as an objective, a policy of paying remuneration around the median of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding 
businesses and it is satisfied that the structure of the executives' packages broadly achieves this objective. The Committee has used this 
comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the risk of upward only reviews of remuneration. The structure of the 
package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of remuneration (annual bonus and long-term incentives) 
constitute a significant proportion of an executive's potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if demanding and stretching 
performance targets are achieved. The Committee considers that the remuneration level and structure are fully competitive with the 
market, with a significant element of the package payable in the form of share-based incentives, subject to long-term performance conditions, 
including relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) performance against other UK housebuilders, thereby creating an alignment with the 
strategy of the business and the long-term interests of shareholders.
In framing the Company's remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice 
provisions in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Association of British Insurers' (ABI ) guidance. When determining the elements 
of remuneration for the executive directors, the Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the 
Group as a whole, paying particular attention to the levels of pay increase awarded to the workforce generally. All employees, including the 
executive directors, can join the Savings Related Share Option Scheme. Most employees have access to pension and life assurance benefits 
and a significant proportion of staff benefit from health insurance, company car or car allowance. 
Summary of Remuneration Policy
The policy in relation to each component of executive remuneration is described below:
Component Policy Performance period How achieved
Salary T o be market competitive. n/a Salary levels set by reference to the mid market level 
of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses, 
taking account of individual performance and experience. 
In practice, notwithstanding the fact that the current 
management team is highly experienced and well 
regarded, salaries are generally at or below the median.
Benefits T o provide a range  
and value which is  
market competitive.
n/a Benefits to be at the mid market level of a peer group of 
similar UK housebuilding businesses, and include a salary 
supplement in lieu of pension contributions, car or car 
allowance, life assurance, medical cover and permanent 
health insurance.
Annual Bonus T o reward achievement of  
annual operational-based 
performance targets.
1 year By providing the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 
100% of salary for outstanding operational performance, 
both financial and non-financial. 
Long-term incentives 
(performance shares  
and matching shares)
T o encourage long-term  
value creation, to aid retention,  
to encourage shareholding, and  
to promote alignment of interest 
with shareholders.
3 years By using share-based incentives with performance 
conditions which are aligned with shareholders' interests, 
such as TSR, which are assessed over a three-year period.

Service Contracts and Letters of Appointment
The executive directors have fixed-term service contracts which specify that retirement is at age 60, with a 12-month notice period from the 
Company and a six-month notice period from the executive. On termination by the Company, an amount equivalent to one year's salary, 
benefits and the average amount of the last two years' annual bonus payments, would be payable. Within six months of a change of control, 
if the Company or the executive director serves notice to terminate the contract, the liquidated damages payment would be triggered.
The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation of compensation payable for early termination will ensure that there is variability in 
the potential level of compensation. In particular, after a period of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be 
payable, reducing potential payout in these circumstances.
The current executive directors have long service with the Company and the Committee does not consider it appropriate to re-negotiate 
their contracts in relation to this material provision. However, for future executives' contracts the Committee will include a provision for 
bonus to be taken into account in the calculation for compensation payable. This will ensure that, going forward, service contracts are 
consistent with current best practice. The details of the executive directors' service contracts are as follows:

from 1 November 2003 and further  
amended 7 October 2009
A M Leitch 1 August 2002 1 September 2002, amended 7 October 2009
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company of no more than three years with a three-month notice period 
by either side.

J A Cuthbert 1 November 2009 1 November 2009 31 October 2012
On the expiry of his existing letter of appointment, it is the intention of the Company, following rigorous review, to issue a new letter of 
appointment to Mr Dawe for a term of three years from 1 November 2010.
Salaries and Fees
Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year, taking into account the general settlement across the Company. Any changes are implemented 
from that date.
For the year under review, the executive directors received no pay rise while the workforce was awarded an increase generally of 2%.  
For 2010/1 1, the executive directors have been awarded a 2.5% increase in basic salary, which will reflect the average percentage increase 
across the workforce generally.
Fee levels for non-executive directors reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role, including membership or chairmanship  
of Board Committees. Fees are reviewed annually, taking into account the level of fees for similar positions in comparable companies. 
For the year under review, fees were not increased from their 2008/09 level. With effect from 1 August 2010, fees have been increased 
by around 6% to reflect the increasing responsibilities, complexity and time commitment of their role. They are not entitled to any benefits 
(with the exception of the Chairman) or pension. They do not participate in any bonus or long-term incentive plan and they are not entitled 
to compensation on termination of their agreements, other than normal notice provisions of three months' notice given by either party.
Taxable Benefits
Taxable benefits provided relate to the provision of motor vehicles, telephones and private medical insurance. 34 Bellway p.l.c.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Annual Bonus Scheme
For the year under review, bonuses were capped at 100% of basic salary. The performance conditions related to operating profit  
(pre-exceptional items) (80%) and personal performance (20%), with personal performance being assessed by reference to board structure 
and succession planning, land bank management, health and safety and customer care. Details of the bonus payments are set out in the notes 
to the table of directors' emoluments on page 36. Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway shares 
under the terms of the Bellway p.l.c. (2008) Share Matching Plan.
The 2010/1 1 bonus will again be based on similar performance parameters as for the 2009/10 bonus and in the same proportions. 
The Committee considers that outperformance of targets in relation to year-on-year profitability and non-financial metrics provide a good 
link to the long-term performance of the business.
Long-term Incentive Schemes
The Company operates two long-term incentive plans which are designed to focus executive directors on longer term value creation, 
provide a strong retentive element and also alignment of interest with shareholders.
The Bellway p.l.c. (2004) Performance Share Plan (the PSP ) was introduced for the Company's executive directors and the Group 
Company Secretary. Under the PSP, executives have been granted awards over shares worth 100% of basic salary each year, subject to the 
achievement of TSR-based performance conditions or, for the award granted in January 2008, a combination of TSR and Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE ) conditions.
The policy for long-term incentives to be granted in the 2010/1 1 financial year, as was the case in prior years, will be for awards to be granted 
over shares worth 100% of basic salary. Awards will vest to executives after three years, subject to the achievement of performance conditions 
based around TSR, which compares the stock market performance (share price movement and dividends paid) of different companies.
The TSR performance condition will compare Bellway's TSR against that of an index created by the average TSR of the other UK housebuilders. 
Awards will start to vest at 25% if Bellway's TSR matches the performance of the index. Full vesting will occur if Bellway's TSR outperforms 
the index by an average of 7.5% per annum over three years. The Committee has carried out significant modelling during the year under 
review, the results of which continue to support the premise that 7.5% per annum outperformance is equivalent to average upper quartile  
TSR performance of the housebuilders over the long term.
The companies comprising the Index for the awards to be granted in the 2010/1 1 financial year are Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley 
Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc.
TSR is recognised as enabling alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders by providing a reward mechanism for delivering 
superior stock market performance. TSR calculations are independently calculated for the Committee by the Company's brokers.
Further, regardless of TSR performance, for the award granted in the 2010/1 1 financial year, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest 
unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying financial performance over the performance period, 
taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and Net Asset Value (NAV ). The Committee will scale back the 
level of vesting indicated by the TSR performance condition (potentially to zero) in circumstances where there has not been an improvement. 
This is a change from the provision applying to previous years' awards, where the requirement was that TSR performance was simply 
reflective of underlying financial performance.
The Bellway p.l.c. (2008) Share Matching Plan (the SMP ) operates in conjunction with the annual bonus plan. Under the SMP senior 
executives may invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus, on a voluntary basis, in Bellway shares, which must be held for a minimum of three 
years. Invested shares will not be subject to a risk of forfeiture and executives will enjoy full beneficial ownership (including voting rights and 
dividends).
In return for investing in shares under the SMP, an award of matching shares is granted. The level of matching is on a gross basis to the net  
of tax bonus invested in shares.
Matching shares will vest subject to the executive remaining employed, retention of the invested shares and also subject to a performance 
condition. 
No awards have been made to date. For any awards which may be made, the performance condition will be the same as will apply to the 
award under the PSP in the same period.
In addition to the two executive plans detailed above, the Bellway p.l.c. (2003) Savings Related Share Option Scheme (2003 SRSOS ) 
is available to all employees, including the executive directors.

Shareholding Guidelines
There is a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors, equivalent to 100% of basic salary. As at 31 July 2010, and at the 
date of this report, all executive directors hold shares with an equivalent value well in excess of 100% of their basic salary. Any executive 
directors appointed in the future will be given an appropriate period of time to acquire the requisite shareholding.
Directors' Interests
The directors' interests (including family interests and holdings in which the directors are interested only as trustees) in the ordinary share 
capital of the Company are set out below:

There has been no change in any of the above interests between 31 July 2010 and the date of this report.
Pensions
In July 2008 the executive directors took enhanced transfer values from the final salary section of the Bellway p.l.c. 1972 Pension & Life 
Assurance Scheme, and therefore have no accrued pension entitlements. Since 1 June 2008 they have received a cash payment in lieu of 
pension contributions amounting to 30% of basic salary. Following advice to the Committee, this amount was agreed as being reasonable 
in the circumstances and was less than the annual accrual foregone by the executive directors under the previous final salary arrangements. 36 Bellway p.l.c.

Notes:
1. Taxable benefits relate to the provision of motor vehicles, telephones and private medical insurance.
2.  The annual bonus is payable in November 2010 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2010. The performance conditions for the 2009/10 bonus were operating profit 
(pre-exceptional items) (80%) and non-financial performance (20%), with non-financial performance being assessed by reference to board structure and succession planning, 
land bank management, health and safety and customer care. The actual bonus payments against each of these metrics were determined on the following basis:
 operating profit was  51.255 million. This was above City expectations of underlying profitability and towards the higher end of the target range. A bonus of 64.259% of salary 
was therefore achieved out of the maximum 80%.
 in respect of the non-financial elements, the Committee took account of performance against each metric and determined that, overall, a bonus of 12.666% of salary should 
be payable out of the maximum 20%.
3. Executive directors receive a cash payment in lieu of pension contribution amounting to 30% of basic salary.

Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration continued
6. The performance conditions for each award are summarised below:
 (a)  For awards made on 18 October 2006, which vested during the year, a TSR performance condition required Bellway's TSR to be at least at the median of a comparator 
group of other housebuilders (at which point 33% of the award vested), and at or above the upper quartile of the comparator group for full vesting. Bellway's TSR was 
above the upper quartile and therefore the awards vested in full. The comparator group comprised Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes 
Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc (plus Crest Nicholson plc, McCarthy & Stone plc, Taylor Woodrow plc and Wilson Bowden plc, all of 
whom have now delisted).
 (b)  For awards made on 16 January 2008, two performance conditions applied to separate parts of the award:
  (i)  50% of the award is based on a TSR condition against other housebuilders but, instead of a ranking approach (comparing Bellway's TSR to that of each other company) 
an Index is created out of the TSR of the other housebuilders in the group. Bellway's TSR is compared to that of the Index. If Bellway's TSR matches that of the Index, 
25% of the TSR part of the award vests (reduced from the previous vesting profile whereby 33% of the award vested at median). Full vesting is achieved for 7.5% per 
annum outperformance of the Index. The companies comprising the Index for the awards made on 16 January 2008 are Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley 
Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc. This TSR condition has been achieved as at 96.6% of the maximum.
  (ii)  The remaining 50% of the award is based on a range of ROCE based targets requiring average annual ROCE of 15% per annum (at which point, 25% of the ROCE part 
of the award would vest) to 22% per annum for all of this part of the award to vest. Awards vest on a straight-line basis in between these two points. This performance 
condition has not been achieved.
 (c)  For the awards made on 4 November 2008 and 29 October 2009 the TSR part of the award applied as the sole performance condition (compared to the same 
companies as for the award made on 16 January 2008). 
 (d)  Regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Company's TSR over the performance period 
reflects underlying financial performance.
7. The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 July 2010 was 579.50p and the range during the year was 560.00p to 927.50p.
8. There has been no change in the above potential future beneficial interests between 31 July 2010 and the date of this report.

Statement of Directors' Responsibilities  
in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent 
company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 the Directors' Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and  
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties  
that they face.
