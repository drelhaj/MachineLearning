 Remuneration report
44 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
The Directors present the Remuneration report for the year ended
31 December 2006. The report contains all of the information that is
required by Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and describes
how the Company has applied the principles of the Code with regard
to remuneration.
1 The Remuneration Committee (unaudited information)
The Board has delegated authority to the Committee to review the
remuneration trends across the Company and its major businesses and
to determine the remuneration and other terms and conditions of the
Chairman, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and the key
management of the Company, as shown on pages 34 and 36. The
Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration of those
individuals identified as senior management by the Board of the Company.
Throughout 2006 the members of the Committee were as follows:
The Hon. James Bruce (Chairman), John Biles, Grey Denham and
Andrew Osborne. All members of the Committee are deemed independent
in accordance with the Code. Details of the number of meetings held
by the Committee during the year, as well as attendance details, can
be found in the table contained in the Corporate Governance report
on page 39.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on request from
the Company Secretary and on the Company's website. The Committee
has access to the advice of the Executive Chairman, the Chief Executive,
the Company Secretary (none of whom participated in any discussion
relating to their own remuneration) and a number of external advisors
in conducting its duties. During 2006 the Committee consulted the
following: Hewitt Associates, who provided the Company with actuarial
advice in relation to pensions; New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , who
provided independent advice to the Committee regarding Executive
Directors' remuneration and long term incentive arrangements (but no
further services to the Company); and Slaughter and May, who provided
the Committee with general legal advice. As the Company's solicitors,
Slaughter and May also provided other legal advice to the Company
during the year.
2 Remuneration policy (unaudited information)
The policy for Executive Directors and key management is designed
to enable the Company to attract, motivate and retain individuals by
ensuring that their rewards are both competitive and linked to individual
and business performance.
Consistent with this policy, the remuneration packages of the Executive
Directors are intended to be competitive and comprise both fixed and
performance-related elements. Performance-related elements are
designed to comprise a significant part of potential remuneration.
Executive Directors' remuneration is reviewed each year to ensure that
it is supportive of the Company's business objectives and the creation of
shareholder value. It is the intention of the Committee that there should
be long-term incentive plans for Executive Directors whereby they are
rewarded with interests in the Company's shares for sustained
performance over a period of time.
The remuneration packages for other key management are designed
to operate on a basis similar to that of the Executive Directors.
3 Remuneration
(a) Executive Directors
(i) Base salary (unaudited information)
The base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually and
following exceptional one-off events where the individual responsibilities
of the Executive Director change significantly. Salaries are benchmarked
against those paid to directors in companies of a similar size and
international complexity to the Company as well as those companies
operating within comparable sectors.
The Committee agreed the following changes to the remuneration
packages and other terms and conditions of David Gawler, Michael Foster
and Robert Careless during the year:
  On standing down from his role as Chief Executive, but remaining
as part-time Executive Chairman, David Gawler's total compensation
was reduced to a base salary of  270,000 per annum with effect from
1 July 2006;
  Michael Foster's base salary was increased to  340,000 with effect
from 1 January 2006. On his promotion from Commercial Director
to Chief Executive, and to reflect the increased responsibilities inherent
in his new role, Michael Foster's base salary was increased to  400,000
per annum with effect from 1 July 2006; and
  Mr Careless' base salary was increased to  225,000 per annum with
effect from 1 January 2006. It was then increased to  250,000 per
annum with effect from 1 July 2006 to bring it into line with salaries
paid to finance directors of similar sized companies.
James Deeley was appointed as Legal Director and Company Secretary
on 10 July 2006 on a base salary of  200,000.
For 2007, salaries have been reviewed and the Executive Directors
received increases broadly in line with the average inflation across
the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
(ii) Bonus (unaudited information)
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2006, all Executive Directors
were contractually entitled to receive a bonus of up to 75 per cent of
base salary depending on the achievement of a number of corporate
and individual targets, including operating profit, cash flow, earnings
per share, Total Shareholder Return ( TSR') and certain other specific
operational targets. The corporate targets were achieved for the year
under review and the TSR performance of the Company during this
period placed it in the upper quartile of the FTSE Mid 250 Index
(excluding investment trusts). Accordingly, all Executive Directors were
recommended for bonuses of 75 per cent of their base salary in respect
of the year ended 31 December 2006. David Gawler was recommended
for a bonus representing 75 per cent of his base salary earned during
the first half of the year under review. Under David Gawler's new service
agreement, which became effective on 1 July 2006, he is no longer
eligible for a bonus.
For 2007, the maximum bonus potential for the Executive Directors
will increase to 100 per cent of salary. This decision was taken by the
Committee having reviewed bonus levels in a comparator group of
companies of similar size and complexity, and across the FTSE 250
as a whole, which showed that the previous maximum of 75 per cent
was well below current market levels. The new maximum level is also
felt to be appropriate given the Company's recent high growth relative
to the market both by market capitalisation (as demonstrated by its
TSR performance) and turnover.
As a condition of increasing the bonus potential, one-quarter of any
bonus paid to Executive Directors (i.e. a maximum of 25 per cent of
salary) will be paid in shares and compulsorily deferred for three years
under a new Deferred Bonus Plan. Therefore, the cash maximum bonus
potential will remain unchanged from 2006 at 75 per cent of salary.
Deferred share awards will normally lapse should the Executive leave
during this three-year period through voluntary resignation or dismissal
for cause. For cessation of employment for any other reason, the Deferred
Share awards will normally vest on cessation unless the Committee
determines otherwise.
The Company's policy is that bonuses should only be payable for the
achievement of stretching performance targets, the majority of which
are linked to the financial performance of the Company. For the year
ending 31 December 2007, these targets are as follows:
1. 64 per cent of bonus: EPS performance relative to budget
2. 16 per cent of bonus: Cash flow performance relative to budget
3. 20 per cent of bonus: Personal performance.
For targets 1 and 2, 50 per cent of the maximum bonus on each part will
be payable for meeting budget, the maximum bonus will only become
payable for performance that is substantially in excess of budget and no
bonus will be payable for performance that is substantially below budget.
The Committee has reserved the overriding discretion to review aggregate
bonus levels payable to Executive Directors based on the above criteria
to ensure that they are appropriate taking into account the overall
financial performance of the Company and its performance relative to
the market. No bonuses payable to Executive Directors are pensionable. Charter plc Annual Report 2006 45
(iii) Long Term Incentives (audited information)
The Executive Directors, with the exception of the Executive Chairman,
currently participate in the Charter 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan.
In addition, Michael Foster was granted an option under a one-off
arrangement put in place specifically to facilitate and secure his
appointment as Commercial Director in 2005.
Charter (DG - 2004) Incentive Plan (the  2004 Plan')
David Gawler was initially granted an award under the Charter (DG)
Incentive Plan (the  2001 Plan') which was approved by shareholders
at the AGM on 25 April 2001. This plan was replaced by the 2004 Plan,
which was approved by shareholders on 25 June 2004 and was on
substantially the same terms as the original 2001 Plan, save with regard
to the vesting date, an appropriate adjustment to take account of the
rights issue on March 2004 and an entitlement for the Company at its
option to settle the award in cash or shares. The middle market price of
shares in the Company when this award was granted was 161.5 pence.
The award under the 2004 Plan vested on 30 June 2006 and was not
pensionable. In accordance with the terms of the 2004 Plan, 1,120,579
ordinary shares of 2 pence each in the Company were issued to
David Gawler, and subsequently sold on his behalf, at a price of 802 pence
each, representing a total value of  8,987,043. The amount of this award
was calculated in accordance with a formula based upon the Company's
share price. According to the terms of the 2004 Plan, the Company had
the option to settle the award in cash or the issue or transfer of shares
in the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or a combination of all or any
of these. The Company elected to settle the award by an issue of new
ordinary shares in the Company.
Michael Foster's Long-term Incentive Plan (the  MF Plan')
No awards were made under the MF Plan in respect of the year under
review and none are intended in the future as the MF Plan was set up as
a one-off scheme. The only award was made in 2005 to Michael Foster in
the circumstances described above. Exercise of 50 per cent of the option
requires average real earnings per share growth of 3 per cent per annum
over a single three-year period whilst the balance of the option relates
to the Company's TSR performance compared to the constituents of
the FTSE Mid 250 Index. No vesting will occur for a below median TSR
ranking, 50 per cent of the TSR part of the grant will vest for a median
ranking and 100 per cent will vest for a ranking within the upper quartile,
with pro rata vesting for intermediate performance. Benefits under the
MF Plan are not pensionable.
The Remuneration Committee may adjust the option as it considers
appropriate. Such adjustment may be to any or all of the nominal
amount and the number of shares under the option and the exercise
price. However, any such adjustment must be on the basis that, so far
as possible, there is no material change to the total exercise price of the
option. The Committee may not reduce the exercise price of an unissued
share to below its nominal value unless and to the extent permitted under
the Companies Act 1985 and the Company's articles of association.
The vested option may be exercised in whole or in part during the period
of twelve months starting with the date of the preliminary announcement
by the Company of its results for the year ending 31 December 2007.
Charter 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP')
Under the LTIP , Executive Directors and selected other senior executives
are eligible to receive awards in one of three forms: (i) conditional
allocations, where a participant receives free ordinary shares in the
Company automatically on vesting; (ii) nil (or nominal) cost options,
where a participant can decide when to exercise his award during a short
period after it has vested; or (iii) forfeitable shares in the Company, which
are similar to conditional shares except that the participant has certain
shareholder rights prior to vesting. The Remuneration Committee may
also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-
based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash (either in whole
or in part), although it does not intend to do so except where it would
be expedient in overseas jurisdictions.
An individual may not receive awards in any financial year over shares
having a market value in excess of 100 per cent of his annual salary
except, in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention,
where an individual may receive an award over shares worth up to 200
per cent of his annual salary.
Vesting will be based on Charter's TSR performance compared to the
constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) over a
single three-year period beginning on the date of the grant of the award.
No vesting will occur for a below median ranking. At median, 25 per cent
of the shares will vest and 100 per cent of the shares will vest at upper
quartile. Between median and upper quartile rankings, awards will vest
on a pro rata basis. In addition, awards will only vest if the Committee is
satisfied that there has been a significant improvement in the Company's
underlying financial performance over the three-year performance period.
The Committee may vary the performance conditions applicable to these
awards to take account of events that the Committee considers to be
exceptional, including technical events such as changes in accounting
standards, provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the Committee,
the varied conditions are at least as challenging as the original condition
would have been but for the event in question. An award will normally
only vest on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant provided
the individual remains an employee of the Company and the performance
conditions and any other objective conditions have been satisfied.
On the vesting of an award the individual acquires fully paid ordinary
shares in the Company.
During the year the Committee made five awards pursuant to the LTIP .
On 24 March 2006, Michael Foster and Robert Careless were made
conditional awards of shares and, on 10 July 2006, James Deeley was
made a conditional award of shares. Details of these awards can be
found on page 49.
(iv) Pensions (audited information)
David Gawler is not a member of the Company's pension scheme.
Prior to stepping down as Chief Executive on 30 June 2006, a contribution
of  63,000 (equivalent to 25 per cent of his salary of  500,000 per annum
during the six-month period to 30 June 2006) was paid to him in lieu
of a pension and is included in his emoluments shown on page 48.
Under David Gawler's new service contract in respect of his position
as Executive Chairman, which became effective on 1 July 2006,
he is not entitled to a pension or a cash payment in lieu of pension
or life assurance.
Michael Foster and Robert Careless are both members of the Company's
HMRC approved pension scheme, providing benefits of one-thirtieth
of base salary and one-forty-fifth of base salary respectively for each year
of service as an Executive Director. They are both subject to a cap on
pensionable earnings of  105,600 per annum and are entitled to receive,
in lieu of pension, an additional 25 per cent of non-pensionable salary
to the extent that their salary exceeds this cap. These payments are
included in their emoluments shown on page 48.
Following his appointment as Legal Director and Company Secretary
on 10 July 2006, James Deeley became a member of the Company's
HMRC approved pension scheme and is provided with benefits
of one-forty-fifth of his base salary for each year of pensionable service.
He is subject to a cap on pensionable earnings of  105,600 and is
entitled to participate in the Company's defined contribution stakeholder
pension scheme in respect of which the Company has agreed to make
a contribution of up to a maximum of 9 per cent of his base salary
in excess of this cap.
Details of pension entitlements can be found in the table on page 48.
(v) Other benefits (audited information)
Further benefits contained within the remuneration packages of the
Executive Directors (with the exception of the Chairman) comprise tax
assessable benefits arising from employment and include car and petrol
allowances, medical insurance for the Executive Directors and their
immediate dependants and life assurance. (vi) Service contracts (audited information)

(vii) Total Shareholder Return (unaudited information)
The chart below sets out the TSR generated by Charter and the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE Mid 250 Index (excluding investment trusts)
since 2001.
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE Mid 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) is the most appropriate index against which the TSR of Charter plc
should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies.

(1) The accrued entitlement includes entitlement earned by Robert Careless as an employee, prior to becoming a Director, as well as that earned for qualifying services after becoming a Director.
(2) The pension entitlement shown in the first row is the aggregate amount which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on service to the end of 2006 under the approved scheme.
(3) The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(4) The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme's liabilities in respect of the
Director's pension benefits. It does not represent sums payable to the individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
(5) The transfer value of the increases in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the change in
his transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in his transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting
the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as additional value earned in the year.
