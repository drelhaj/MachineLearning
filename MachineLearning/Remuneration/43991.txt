Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear shareholder
As you will be aware, 2013 was another challenging year for the Group, with a change of both Chief Executive and 
Finance Director, sharp reductions in military budgets throughout our NATO markets, rapid destocking of consumables - 
which make up much of our sales - as troops withdrew from conflict areas such as Afghanistan, and the US Government 
shutdown as we approached our year end.
At the time of the appointment of the new Chief Executive and Finance Director, we made a number of temporary 
changes to our remuneration arrangements to reflect the uncertainties which they inherited and the fact that, in their 
first year, they would be operating under a budget, the preparation of which they had had no part in. For the current 
year beginning 1 November 2013, we are returning to a more conventional policy and I summarise the key changes 
below.
  The structure of the bonus plan was changed in 2013 from a 75%/25% split between financial measures and personal 
objectives to a 60%/40% split between the same metrics. This was to reflect the uncertainties in the integrity of the 
Group's budget, and to reflect the number of key, short-term actions which were required to be completed during 
2013, to reposition the Company going forward. In addition, Mark Papworth and Steve Bowers were guaranteed 
a minimum bonus in their first year equivalent to 50% of base salary because of the uncertainties outlined above 
and the need to attract strong replacements over a very short period of time. The circumstances surrounding the 
appointment of these two executive directors were exceptional and this was fully disclosed to shareholders in last 
year's remuneration report. 
  Mark Papworth and Steve Bowers will receive their guaranteed minimum bonuses for 2013 (with Steve Bowers' bonus 
being prorated to reflect his January 2013 start date) and Sarah Ellard (Group Legal Director & Company Secretary) 
will receive a below-target bonus of 36% of salary. 40% of the payouts will be deferred in shares for three years. 
The actual bonus payments due to the executive directors for 2013 are set out on page 77 of the remuneration 
report.  
  In 2014, the weighting on financial measures in the annual bonus will be increased, with a requirement for 
achievement of threshold financial measures before any element of the personal objectives can become payable. The 
financial targets will again be based on a mix of earning per share (EPS ) and cash flow. The personal objectives will 
be measurable and consistent with the Group's longer-term goals. Details of the personal objectives and performance 
against them will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2014 annual report.
  When granting performance share plan awards to both the new executive directors and other senior executives 
in 2013, the Committee did not feel that they could set sufficiently robust three year EPS targets because of the 
uncertain conditions at that time and therefore absolute share price targets were set. The policy for 2014 and 
beyond will be to use two metrics, namely growth in underlying EPS and relative total shareholder return (TSR ) 
measured against an international peer group of defence sector companies. These measures have been selected by 
the Remuneration Committee as they are aligned to the success of the Group's recovery. EPS is a measure of the 
Group's overall financial success and TSR provides an external assessment of the Company's performance against 
companies of a similar size and complexity. TSR also aligns the rewards received by executives with the returns 
received by shareholders. Each will determine the vesting of 50% of the 2014 awards. 25% of each part of the award 
will vest for threshold or median performance, with full vesting of each part of the award for stretch or upper quartile 
performance. The EPS performance targets for 2014 have not yet been determined but in accordance with our normal 
practice, will appropriately reflect market expectations for the Company at the time of grant, as well as our own 
internal expectations. The performance targets will be disclosed in the relevant RIS announcement when the awards 
are granted. 
  In reviewing the salaries of Mark Papworth and Steve Bowers for 2014, the Committee was cognisant of the 
circumstances which prevailed at the time of their recruitment in late 2012. We were very much aware that the 
condition of the Company at that time, combined with the deteriorating market conditions within the defence industry, 
meant that the Company was facing an extremely challenging and complex few years. Mark and Steve were selected 
as we believed that they had the drive and character to deliver the recovery which the Company required. However, 
we were aware of their relative inexperience and decided to adopt the principle outlined in our remuneration policy

Remuneration policy
This report sets out the information required by Part 4 of Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended). The report also satisfies the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions 
relating to directors' remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Remuneration Committee has been established by the Board and is responsible for executive remuneration. The 
Committee's terms of reference are available in full on the Company's website or from the Company Secretary on request.
In determining remuneration for the executive directors and other senior managers, the Remuneration Committee seeks to 
maintain a competitive package of rewards, which enables the Company to attract and retain the highest calibre of executive, 
without being excessive by reference to market rates across comparator companies. Performance-related elements form 
a significant proportion of the total remuneration package of each executive director, and take into account the individual 
contribution of each executive and the performance of the business against financial objectives, details of which are set out 
below. These variable elements are designed to align the interest of executives with shareholders, by ensuring that a significant 
proportion of remuneration is performance-related and delivered in shares. 
The table below summarises the Committee's policy for the remuneration of executive directors, which, if approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting, will become binding immediately thereafter. Further details of the full policy 
are set out below the table on pages 66 and 67. 
of bringing them in below market rate, with a view to reviewing progress and bringing them up to that level when 
appropriate. Against this background and acknowledging the tremendous progress made in addressing the underlying 
issues facing the Company in their first year, Mark Papworth's salary has been increased by 5.6% to  475,000 and 
Steve Bowers' salary has been increased by 9.1% to  300,000. Sarah Ellard's salary has been increased by 3.1% to 
 216,500, in line with the general level of increases received by other employees. 
 
Now that the increased salaries are considered by the Committee to represent the correct level for each role, the 
Committee anticipates that these salaries will be increased in line with those of the general workforce for the next few 
years.
  In 2014, we are also amending our policy on paying dividend equivalents on vested performance share plan awards 
and deferred bonus share awards. Currently, participants do not receive the value of dividends on their awards, and 
in order to increase alignment with shareholders and bring our arrangements into line with market practice, dividend 
equivalents will be paid on vested performance share plan awards and deferred bonus share awards granted from 
2014.
Since the start of the current financial year I have discussed these changes with a number of our largest shareholders 
and the Committee has listened carefully to their comments. We welcome feedback from all interested parties and 
hope that you are able to support our policy and the way in which it has been applied in the year at the Annual General 
Meeting on 20 March 2014.

Notes:
1.  A description of how the Company intends to implement the policy set out in this table for 2014 is set out in the annual report on remuneration on pages 76 
and 77. The remuneration policy for the executive directors and other senior executives is designed with regard to the policy for employees across the Group 
as a whole. However, there are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for senior executives. In general, these differences arise from the 
development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories of individuals. They also reflect the fact that, in the case of 
the executive directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed on performance-related pay in the market.

directors' remuneration report
Committee discretions
The Committee operates the Group's variable incentive plans according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC 
rules where relevant. To ensure the efficient administration of these plans, the Committee will apply certain operational 
discretions. These include the following:
  selecting the participants in the plans on an annual basis;
  determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payment;
  determining the quantum of awards and/or payments (within the limits set out in the policy table above);
  determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance;
  making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. change of control, rights issues, corporate 
restructuring events, and special dividends); 
  determining good leaver  status for incentive plan purposes and applying the appropriate treatment; and
  undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance measures, and setting targets for the annual bonus plan and PSP 
from year to year.
If an event occurs which results in the annual bonus plan or PSP performance conditions and/or targets being deemed no 
longer appropriate (e.g. a material acquisition or divestment), the Committee will have the ability to adjust appropriately the 
measures and/or targets and alter weightings, provided that the revised conditions or targets are not materially less difficult to 
satisfy.
Outstanding share incentive awards that remain unvested or unexercised at the date of this report, as detailed on pages 81 and 
82 of the annual report on remuneration, remain eligible for vesting or exercise based on their original award terms.
Selection of performance metrics and targets
The performance-related elements of remuneration take into account the Group's risk policies and systems, and are designed 
to align the senior executives' interests with those of shareholders. The Committee reviews the annual bonus plan measures set 
for all of the Group's senior executives (not just the executive directors) every year, in order to ensure that they are aligned with 
the Group's strategy and to ensure consistent bonus arrangements amongst the senior executive team. All financial targets 
are set on a sliding scale. Non-financial targets are set at the beginning of the year based on individual and management team 
responsibilities.
The annual bonus plan performance metrics include a mix of financial targets and personal objectives, reflecting the key 
annual priorities of the Group. The financial metrics determine the majority of the bonus and normally include cash flow - a 
key measure of the Group's ability to invest in the business and pay dividends to its shareholders - and EPS, which reflects the 
Group's financial performance and is a key measure for its shareholders. The personal objectives agreed on an annual basis will 
be measurable and based on individual performance, and will be consistent with the achievement of the Group's longer-term 
goals.
The Remuneration Committee has decided to apply TSR and EPS performance conditions to awards to be made under the PSP 
in 2014 and future years, as these measures are directly aligned to the success of the Group's recovery. EPS is a measure 
of the Group's overall financial success and TSR provides an external assessment of the Company's performance against its 
peer group. TSR also aligns the rewards received by executives with the returns received by shareholders. The actual EPS 
performance targets for PSP awards to be granted in 2014 have not yet been determined but in accordance with the normal 
practice, will appropriately reflect market expectations for the Company at the time of grant, as well as the Board's own internal 
expectations. The performance targets will be disclosed in the relevant RIS announcement when the awards are granted. 
Further details on the TSR targets for 2014 awards are set out on page 77 of the annual report on remuneration. 
The Committee will review the choice and relative balance of performance measures and the appropriateness of performance 
targets prior to each grant of awards under the PSP. The EPS targets are reset prior to each grant, following a review of internal 
and external expectations of future EPS growth for the Group. The TSR comparator group is reviewed prior to each grant to 
ensure it remains appropriate. The Committee retains discretion to set different targets for future awards, providing that, in 
the opinion of the Committee, the new targets are no less challenging in light of the prevailing circumstances than those set 
previously.

How employees' pay is taken into account
In addition to determining the remuneration arrangements for the executive directors, the Committee considers and approves 
the base salaries for sixteen other senior executives, and reviews salaries for the next tier of management at each of the 
Group's businesses. The Committee also receives information on general pay levels and policies across the Group. The 
Committee, therefore, has due regard to salary levels across the Group in applying its remuneration policy.
How the executive directors' remuneration policy relates to the wider Group
The remuneration policy described above provides an overview of the structure that operates for the most senior executives in 
the Group. Lower aggregate incentive quanta are applied at below executive level, with levels driven by market comparatives 
and the impact of the role.
Employees are provided with a competitive package of benefits, which typically includes participation in the Group's defined 
contribution pension arrangements.
Long-term incentives are provided to the most senior executives and those identified as having the greatest potential to 
influence performance within the Group. However, in order to encourage wider employee share ownership, the Company also 
operates a Sharesave Plan in the UK and a Stock Purchase Plan in the US, in which all UK and US employees are eligible to 
participate on completion of six months' service.
How shareholders' views are taken into account
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received on the directors' remuneration report each year 
and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally. Shareholders' views are key inputs when shaping 
remuneration policy.
In December 2013 and January 2014, the Committee consulted with the Company's largest shareholders on the proposed 
changes for 2014, including the choice and weighting of performance measures in the incentive arrangements and the level 
of salary increases for the executive directors. The feedback received has been reflected in the policy that is presented in this 
report.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into 
with current or former directors (such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes) that have been 
disclosed to shareholders in previous directors' remuneration reports. Details of any payments to former directors will be set 
out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.

Potential remuneration scenarios for executive directors
The chart below details the hypothetical composition of each executive director's remuneration package and how it could vary 
at different levels of performance under the future policy set out above. The executive directors will not receive either the 
target  or maximum  packages in 2014, as there are no performance share plan awards due to vest.

awards of 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and other executive directors.
2.  The PSP awards section of the bars is shaded, as these awards are subject to performance in future years and cannot ordinarily vest until three years after grant. 
3.  Salary levels (on which other elements of the packages are calculated) are based on those applying to 31 December 2013.
4.  The value of taxable benefits is based on an estimated cost of  22,000 for Mark Papworth,  20,000 for Steve Bowers and  16,000 for Sarah Ellard.
5.  Pension provision is 20% of salary for each director.
6.  The executive directors may participate in all-employee share schemes on the same basis as other employees. The value that may be received under these 
schemes is subject to tax-approved limits. For simplicity, the value that may be received from participating in these schemes has been excluded from the above 
charts.

Assumptions:
1.  2013 Actual = fixed pay (2013 annualised salary plus benefits plus pension cash supplement) plus the cash element of the 2013 bonus award. 
2014 Target = fixed pay (2014 salary plus benefits plus pension cash supplement) plus target annual cash bonus of 37.5% of salary for the Chief Executive and 
30% for the other executive directors. 
Maximum = maximum annual cash bonus of 75% of salary for the Chief Executive and 60% for the other executive directors.
2. Other assumptions as above. 
Policy on payments for loss of office
All new executive directors appointed will have service contracts which are terminable on a maximum of twelve months' notice. 
Provisions permitting the Company to make any termination payments by instalments, and requiring directors to mitigate 
their loss in such circumstances, will be included in each contract. The Remuneration Committee will exercise discretion in 
determining whether termination payments should be paid by instalments, taking account of the reason for the departure of 
the director and their prior performance. Other than in gross misconduct situations, the Company would expect to honour the 
contractual entitlements of terminated directors.
Other than in certain good leaver  circumstances (including, but not limited to, redundancy, ill-health or retirement), no bonus 
would be payable unless the individual remains employed and is not under notice at the payment date. Any bonuses paid to a 
good leaver  would be based on an assessment of their individual and the Company's performance over the period, and  
prorated for the proportion of the bonus year worked.
With regards to long-term incentive awards, the PSP rules provide that other than in certain good leaver  circumstances, 
awards lapse on cessation of employment. Where an individual is a good leaver , the Remuneration Committee's policy for 
future PSP awards will be to permit awards to remain outstanding until the end of the original performance period, when a 
pro rata reduction will be made to take account of the proportion of the vesting period that lapsed prior to termination of 
employment, although the Committee has discretion to partly or completely disapply prorating and the performance conditions 
in exceptional circumstances. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to deem an individual to be a good leaver . In doing 
so, it will take account of the reason for their departure and the performance of the individual. 
Deferred bonus share awards will also normally lapse on cessation of employment, unless the executive director is deemed to 
be a good leaver  by the Remuneration Committee, as referred to above. 
The Committee will have authority to settle legal claims against the Company (e.g. for unfair dismissal, discrimination or 
whistleblowing) that arise on termination. The Committee may also authorise the provision of outplacement services.

directors' remuneration report
Executive directors' service agreements and loss of office payments
The current executive directors have rolling service contracts, details of which are summarised in the table below:
Provision Detailed terms
Contract dates Mark Papworth - 22 October 2012 (effective 5 November 2012)
Steve Bowers - 2 January 2013 (effective 7 January 2013)
Sarah Ellard - 2 November 2011 (effective 7 October 2011)
Notice period Twelve months from both the Company and from the executive
Termination payment
1
Contracts may be terminated without notice by the payment of a sum equal to the sum of 
salary due for the unexpired notice period plus the fair value of any contractual benefits 
(including pension) 
Payments may be made in instalments and in these circumstances there is a requirement to 
mitigate loss
Incentive arrangements A pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service, along with 
vesting of outstanding performance share plan and deferred bonus share awards (see above) 
Notes:
1.  Mark Papworth's contract originally contained additional provisions in the event of a change of control; however, these ceased to apply from 5 November 2013.
The executive directors' service contracts are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
Recruitment of executive directors
Salaries for new hires (including internal promotions) will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Company's intended 
pay positioning, and the market rate for the applicable role.
Where it is appropriate to offer a below median salary initially, the Committee will have the discretion to allow phased salary 
increases over a period of time for newly-appointed directors, even though this may involve increases in excess of the rate for 
the wider workforce and inflation.
Benefits will be provided in line with those offered to other executive directors, taking account of local market practice, with 
relocation expenses or arrangements provided if necessary. Tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is adversely 
affected by taxation due to their employment with the Company. Legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual may also 
be paid by the Company.
The aggregate incentive opportunity offered to new recruits will normally be no higher than that offered under the annual 
bonus plan and the PSP to the existing executive directors. Different performance measures and targets may be set initially 
for the annual bonus plan, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual and the point in the financial year at which 
they join. Any increases in incentive quantum offered above this limit will be contingent on the Company receiving shareholder 
approval for an amendment to its approved policy at its next general meeting.
Current entitlements (benefits, bonus, share schemes) may be bought out on terms that are no more favourable than a  
like-for-like basis (with a comparable time horizon, fair value and subject to performance conditions). The Group's existing 
incentive arrangements will be used to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes, if 
necessary, and as permitted under the Listing Rules. 
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms of grant (adjusted as relevant to take into account the Board appointment).

Advisers
During the year, the Committee retained New Bridge Street (an Aon Hewitt company, part of Aon plc) to advise on remuneration 
and incentive plan related matters and the setting of remuneration for new appointments. New Bridge Street was appointed by 
the Committee and is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants' Group Code of Conduct, which sets out guidelines to ensure 
that its advice is independent and free from undue influence. The Company received no other services from New Bridge Street, 
or any other part of the Aon group of companies, during the year. The fees paid to New Bridge Street in 2013 were  65,936 
(2012:  27,198). The Committee reviews the performance and independence of its advisers on an annual basis.
The Committee consults internally with the Chief Executive, Mark Papworth, and the Group Legal Director & Company 
Secretary, Sarah Ellard.

directors' remuneration report
Application of the remuneration policy for 2014
Base salary
The executive directors' salaries were reviewed in early January 2014. The salary increases, which took effect from  
1 January 2014, are set out below. The background to the increases applied to Mark Papworth's and Steve Bowers' salaries 
are set out in the statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on pages 64 and 65. The percentage increase 
applied to Sarah Ellard's salary was consistent with the average salary increase to UK employees.
Salary as at 1 January 2013
(or date of appointment, if later) Salary as at 1 January 2014 % Increase
Mark Papworth  450,000  475,000 5.6%
Steve Bowers  275,000  300,000 9.1%
Sarah Ellard  210,000  216,500 3.1%
f ees for the Chairman and non-executive directors
As detailed in the remuneration policy, the Company's approach to setting the non-executive directors' remuneration takes 
account of recognised practice, and is set at a level that is sufficient to attract and retain high-calibre non-executives. Details of 
the fees are set out below:
Fees as at 1 January 2013 Fees as at 1 January 2014 % increase
Chairman's fees  170,000  187,000 10%
1
Other non-executive directors' base fee  55,000  55,000 -
Audit Committee Chair fee  8,000  8,000 -
Remuneration Committee Chair fee  8,000  8,000 -
Notes:
1.  The Chairman's annual fees of  187,000 have been fixed for his current three year term of appointment, which expires on 30 June 2016. His previous annual 
fee of  170,000 was also fixed for his original three year term.
Annual bonus plan performance targets
The annual bonus plan for 2014 will largely operate on a similar basis to 2013. However, in 2013, the weighting of personal 
objectives was increased to 40% of the total bonus opportunity on an exceptional basis, reflecting the importance of  
delivering key strategic and operational goals in the year. For the 2014 bonus plan, the weighting of personal objectives for 
Mark Papworth and Sarah Ellard has reverted back to 25% of the total bonus opportunity. However, Steve Bowers' personal 
objectives will contribute to 35% of his bonus opportunity for 2014, as the Committee feels that a slightly greater weighting 
on personal objectives is appropriate for Steve, given the importance of addressing the currently complex position in relation 
to debt holders and improving financial management in the business. The personal objectives set for Steve will reflect these 
priorities, and will include targets relating to the Group's discussions with debt holders and restructuring the balance sheet.
In 2014, the performance measures and weightings for the annual bonus plan will therefore be as follows:
Measure As a percentage of maximum bonus opportunity
Mark Papworth Steve Bowers Sarah Ellard
EPS 37.5% 32.5% 37.5%
Cash flow 37.5% 32.5% 37.5%
Personal objectives 25.0% 35.0% 25.0%
No bonus will be payable in respect of the personal objectives unless threshold performance has been achieved against both 
the EPS and cash flow targets. Further details of the targets are not being disclosed prospectively as these are commercially 
sensitive. A detailed description of the personal objectives and performance against them will be included in next year's annual 
report on remuneration. 
The 2014 bonus plan is consistent with the policy detailed in the remuneration policy in terms of maximum bonus opportunity, 
deferred share arrangements and clawback.

Long-term incentive targets
The policy for annual awards granted to the executive directors under the PSP in 2014 and beyond will be to use two metrics, 
namely growth in adjusted EPS and relative TSR measured against an international peer group of defence sector companies 
as listed below. Each metric will determine the vesting of 50% of the 2014 awards. 25% of each part of the award will vest for 
threshold or median performance, with full vesting of each part of the award for stretch or upper quartile performance. The 
EPS performance targets for 2014 have not yet been determined but in accordance with the Committee's normal practice, 
will appropriately reflect market expectations for the Company at the time of grant, as well as the Board's own internal 
expectations. The performance targets will be disclosed in the relevant RIS announcement when the awards are granted.
The defence sector peer group for the 2014 awards comprises: Alliant Techsystems; BAE Systems; Cobham; Cohort; Esterline 
Technologies; Finmeccanica; FLIR Systems; L3 Communications; Manroy; Qinetiq Group; Raytheon; Rheinmetall; Rockwell 
Collins; and Ultra Electronics.

directors' remuneration report
Details of variable pay earned in the year
Annual bonus
The Committee has consistently set highly challenging bonus targets for the achievement of maximum bonuses. No bonuses 
were paid to executive directors for 2011 and 2012, and the executive directors did not receive maximum bonuses in any of 
the prior three years.
As disclosed last year and as described in the Statement by the Committee Chairman as part of their recruitment terms,  
Mark Papworth and Steve Bowers each had an entitlement to a minimum bonus of 50% of salary for 2013 only.
In 2013, the annual bonus plan threshold performance was not achieved in relation to either the EPS or cash flow targets, as 
a consequence of the difficult trading conditions which impacted the Group's performance during the year. The actual financial 
performance targets are not disclosed, as they are considered to be commercially sensitive. The performance against the

build-up and maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent to one year's basic salary, by retaining 50% of the after-tax 
gain on vested PSP awards until such time as the guidelines have been met. Other participants in the PSP are expected to 
retain a shareholding equivalent to 25% to 50% of their basic salary.

Notes:
1.  Transfer values represent liabilities of the applicable scheme, and do not represent sums paid to individuals.
2.  Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Occupational Pension Scheme (Transfer Value) Regulations 1996. 
3.   Sarah Ellard left pensionable service on 6 April 2010 and therefore has not accrued additional pension over the year. The accrued benefits shown are the 
benefits at the date of exit.
4.  The scheme provided pension at a rate of 1/80th of final pensionable salary plus a cash lump sum of 3/80ths for each year of membership. Final pensionable 
salary was capped at the HMRC notional earnings cap, and the scheme assumed a normal retirement age of 65. Early retirement is permissible from age 55 but 
accrued benefits are reduced accordingly using the early retirement factors in force at the date of early retirement.
Loss of office payments
No compensation for loss of office was paid to any director during the year. The principles governing compensation for loss of 
office are set out on page 71.
Payments to past directors
No payments were made to past directors during the year.

 1.3 million of the staff costs figure for 2013 relates to pay for the executive directors. This is different to the aggregate of the 
single figures for the year under review due to the way in which share-based awards are accounted for.
The dividends figures relate to amounts payable in respect of the relevant financial year.

RESOLvE
ReSOLVe is a state-of-the-art field 
proven electronic surveillance and 
attack system. It is designed for the 
interception, geolocation, exploitation 
and denial of tactical communications 
in the HF to uHF frequency bands, 
including modern waveforms . t he 
underlying technology has been 
developed at Chemring technology 
Solutions over many years, building on 
world class expertise in RF and signal 
processing techniques.
A single ReSOLVe system can be used 
in isolation to provide both full spectrum 
surveillance and direction finding (dF) 
capabilities, and when networked with 
other ReSOLVe systems it is then 
possible to position fix targets using 
angle of arrival techniques.
A version of the equipment first came 
into service with the uk Ministry of 
defence under urgent operational 
requirement (uOR) in 2011, requiring 
the eventual delivery of over seventy 
systems. development of the underlying 
technology has continued and more 
than 100 ReSOLVe systems are now 
in-service or on order with numerous 
customers in europe, Australia and the 
Middle east with strong interest from 
South, Central and Northern America, 
the Far east, and eastern europe. 22918-04 6 February 2014 11:42 AM Proof 13
