 Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2009 inviting them to consider and approve this report.
The auditors are required to report to the Company's members on that part of this remuneration report which is subject to audit and to state whether, 
in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
This report is therefore presented in two sections: unaudited information and audited information.
Section 1: Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up solely of non-executive directors with no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters to 
be decided. Those non-executive directors serving on the Remuneration Committee during 2008 were Mr Colin Holmes as Chairman, Mr John Warren, 
Mrs Lesley MacDonagh and, since 1 October 2008, Mr Alastair Lyons. Meetings of the Remuneration Committee are held as and when appropriate and at
least annually. During 2008, the Remuneration Committee met on six occasions and all members, then current, attended each meeting with the exception
of Mrs Lesley MacDonagh who missed two meetings by prior arrangement. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, from time to time, calls upon Mr Malcolm Harris (Chairman) and Mr David Ritchie (Chief Executive) to assist in discussions and
deliberations of the Remuneration Committee on remuneration matters not pertaining to the remuneration or terms and conditions of his own employment.
The Remuneration Committee has, on occasion, appointed the services of external advisers to advise on director remuneration. The Hay Group has been
appointed as adviser to the Remuneration Committee on an ongoing basis, has no other connection with the Company and provides reports and advice 
as required. ExcellerateHRO Share Plan Services (formerly Towers Perrin) act as Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan. The Group
Company Secretary, Mr Martin Palmer, acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
Duties of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the following duties:
  Determine on behalf of the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive, the
executive directors and such other members of the executive management as it is designated to consider. 
  Ensure that executive directors and senior management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are rewarded
for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
  Determine targets for any performance related pay schemes and ask the Board, when appropriate, to seek shareholder approval for any long term 
incentive arrangements.
  Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance criteria of all share based remuneration schemes.
  Ensure that contractual terms on termination and any payments made avoid rewarding poor performance and approve any severance payments.
  Determine the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman, Chief Executive, each executive director and other designated senior executives,
including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share awards.
  Determine the policy for and scope of service agreements for executive directors and pensions arrangements, termination payments and compensation
commitments.
  Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance conditions of the annual bonus scheme and approve annual bonuses.
  In determining remuneration packages and arrangements, give due regard to the requirements and recommendations of the Combined Code as well as
the UK Listing Authority's Listing Rules and associated guidance.
  Review competitor companies but ensure that automatic increases are not implemented.
  Oversee any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company.
 
Ensure that the provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration, including pensions, as set out in the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002,
are fulfilled and produce an annual report of the Committee's remuneration policy to be included in the Company's Annual Report and Accounts.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Group's website www.bovishomes.co.uk/plc and on request to the Group 
Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company's policy for the remuneration of executive directors, having regard to the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 (Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985) and the Combined Code and its provisions on directors' remuneration, including 
Schedule A.
Report on directors' remuneration
30 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomes.co.uk/plc The Remuneration Committee sets and implements remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and designated senior management. 
The Remuneration Committee determines the need for independent professional advice where appropriate and has regard to information on compensation
and salary levels in companies in the housebuilding sector and in other companies of comparable size, for executives with similar skills, qualifications 
and experience. The objectives of the remuneration policy are to:
 
ensure that the individual rewards and incentives fairly relate to the performance of the individual, the Company and the interests of shareholders;
  maintain a remuneration package which enables the Company to attract, retain, and motivate executives of the appropriate calibre and experience to
further the success of the Company and maximise long term shareholder value; and
  take into account pay and employment conditions throughout the Group.
The remuneration policy was reviewed by the Remuneration Committee during 2008.
Remuneration package
The remuneration package of the executive directors consists of basic salary, performance bonus, health insurance, membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated
Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS), pension, death in service assurance, and participation in employee share schemes and the Bovis Homes
Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
In prior years, participation in the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme and Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan has also formed part
of the executive directors' remuneration package. The Group suspended use of the Executive Share Option Scheme during 2004 and this scheme expired 
in 2007, although options previously granted to executive directors are still current. During 2004, the Group also suspended use of the share incentive 
plan in respect of the awarding of free shares in the Company.
The Remuneration Committee aims to balance appropriately those elements of an executive director's remuneration which are subject to explicit performance
conditions, accepting that all remuneration is linked with ongoing appraisal of individual performance. By virtue of the various elements of directors'
remuneration subject to performance conditions, a significant part is variable and is not guaranteed. The potential remuneration package, dependent on
performance, reflects one-third fixed and two-thirds variable elements. Whilst the Remuneration Committee aims to achieve this balance, it recognises that
the payout in any year will vary from this. The chart below to the left shows this graphically.
For remuneration earned during 2008 the fixed element, being salary, and variable elements, which include bonus in respect of the 2008 financial year and
gains on the exercise of LTIP awards granted in 2005, are shown, by director, in the three charts immediately above and to the right. No bonus awards were
made to the executive directors in respect of the 2008 financial year. As Mr Neil Cooper commenced with the Company on 2 January 2007 he had no
entitlement to exercise awards under the LTIP during 2008. Mr Cooper's remuneration therefore comprised solely salary.
Salary
Executive director salaries are reviewed annually on 1 January with effect from 1 January 2009 taking into account the total remuneration package at the
time of the review. No rises were awarded to the executive directors in the 2009 review. Salaries were previously reviewed in July each year.
External directorships
Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and organisations outside 
the Group. Earnings arising from such external directorships are payable directly to the Company. Neither of the executive directors currently has any 
such appointments.
Performance bonus 2008
During 2008, executive directors were able to earn a performance cash bonus up to a maximum of 100% of basic annual salary prevailing at the date of the
Remuneration Committee meeting to determine bonuses. It is considered that such maximum performance bonus levels create an appropriate level of short
term incentive, and align suitably with the performance bonus entitlements of other companies in the housebuilding sector as well as other publicly listed
companies of a similar size to the Company.
Bonuses for executive directors have been determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference to challenging performance criteria including exceeding
the previous year's profit before taxation by a specified percentage and the achievement of other strategic targets. To the end of 2008, the bonuses of the
executive directors have been assessed and paid from a bonus pool which is generated from increases in profits over the previous year. All office based
employees share in any bonus pool. The rules governing the generation of the bonus pool remained consistent with prior years. Site employees are incentivised
through direct site bonus schemes based on measurable site performance.
The bonus pool has been designed to remain at zero until profits before taxation and bonus charge increase over the prior year by 2% above the increase in the
Retail Price Index ( RPI'). Thereafter, for every 1% increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge over the prior year, a value equal to 0.5% of the Group's
profit before taxation and bonus charge is allocated to the bonus pool. This applies until the increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge reaches 
12% over the increase in RPI at which point the total value allocated to the bonus pool is capped. At this maximum value the bonus pool will equal 5% of the
Group's profit before taxation and bonus charge. Bonus payments in aggregate are restricted to a maximum equal to the value allocated to the bonus pool.

400 Any bonus pool is applied in settling individual employee bonuses subject to individual performance, corporate performance and set bonus caps. Any surplus
bonus pool remaining after settling employee bonuses reverts to the Group and is included in the profits for that financial year.
Executive directors have a bonus cap equal to 100% of basic salary. In addition to the requirement for the bonus pool to have sufficient value to pay employee
bonuses, the Remuneration Committee established challenging performance criteria for executive directors to determine bonus levels. For bonuses equal to
100% of basic salary to be considered for payment, specific financial criteria had to be met, including:
  achievement of an increase in Group profits before taxation and bonus of 10%; and
  achievement of return on capital employed in excess of 20% for the year; and
  achievement of the Group's budgeted profit before taxation for the year.
No bonuses were paid to executive directors in 2008 in respect of the 2007 financial year after considering the achievement or otherwise of the performance
criteria set for the financial year 2007. Following the consideration of performance criteria set for the financial year 2008 the Remuneration Committee has
resolved not to award bonuses to the executive directors serving during 2008.
Performance bonus 2009
Given the current trading conditions within the UK housing market and the Group's current focus on cash flow generation, the Remuneration Committee
considers it inappropriate to operate the cash bonus scheme during 2009. The Remuneration Committee is proposing that entitlement to be considered for
cash bonus in 2009 is forfeited by the executive directors and other senior executives, to be replaced by awards in a Bonus Replacement Share Plan aimed at
providing incentives for outperformance by senior management against defined performance measures which the Remuneration Committee considers will
be clearly aligned with the creation of shareholder value. The Remuneration Committee has consulted widely with shareholders on the proposal to form the
Bonus Replacement Share Plan and has met with shareholders holding in excess of 50% of the Company's share capital. Comments from shareholders have
been considered and the plan has been adapted following the consultation. The Remuneration Committee intends only using this share plan for 2009.
Challenging performance conditions focused on improvements to the Company's share price over three years will be used to assess the levels of any vesting
of such awards. The Plan rules will include an over-riding discretion for the Remuneration Committee to determine the level of awards which vest if it considers
that vesting has been significantly influenced by external improvements in market conditions rather than through strong performance from management,
thus ensuring the rewards of vesting are justified by performance. Vesting awards will be satisfied through the issue of new shares. Accordingly, shareholder
approval to the share bonus performance plan will be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Pension
Two of the executive directors who served during 2008 were senior executive members of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme. This is a contributory funded,
defined benefit scheme approved by HMRC. Pensionable earnings were equal to basic pay prior to 6 April 2006. From 6 April 2006, increases in pensionable
earnings are restricted each year to the lesser of the percentage increase in basic pay and 2.5%. Prior to retirement on 2 July 2008, Mr Malcolm Harris was
not subject to the earnings cap. Mr David Ritchie is subject to the statutory earnings cap for service until 5 April 2006 and, following the introduction of the
lifetime allowance pension rules on 6 April 2006, is not subject to an earnings cap for service from 6 April 2006. Normal retirement age for senior executive
members under the scheme is 60, and the accrual rate is 1/45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service as a senior executive.
Mr Neil Cooper was a member of the Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan during 2008, a contracted-in defined contribution arrangement, to which
the Company contributes 7% of basic annual salary per annum. Normal retirement age for joiners after 1 October 2006 is age 65.
Share schemes
The Company employs a standard set of performance conditions for all executive directors in respect of outstanding options under the Bovis Homes Group
PLC Executive Share Option Scheme and awards under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan. These performance conditions are described under
specific headings in this report. The granting of awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
The performance conditions are designed to challenge and motivate executive directors to improve profitability and enhance shareholder return. 
The conditions are also designed to require strong collective and individual performance from the executive directors before options and awards vest, whilst
at the same time offering a credible opportunity for success.
For share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to vest an independent report is provided by the Company's auditors, as independent
experts, to the Company confirming achievement of the relevant performance conditions. The performance conditions attaching to share options and awards
under the Long Term Incentive Plan are selected intentionally to be derived from readily available information which is straightforward and transparent. 
This ensures that the auditors can make objective assessments of achievement against the performance conditions.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997. The Remuneration Committee suspended the issuing of new share
options on 5 May 2004. It is an HMRC approved scheme which expired in 2007 and historically granted share options on an approved basis within HMRC
limits and on an unapproved basis outside HMRC limits. The rules of the scheme relating to vesting and exercising outstanding share options remained
unaltered at the scheme's expiry.
For outstanding share options, the performance criteria require that any share option held under the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme
can only normally be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in
RPI by at least 4% per annum over three consecutive years.
The exercise price of a share option has been determined by the Board at the date of grant and has not been less than the higher of the market value and
nominal value of an ordinary share in the Company at the date of grant.
Assuming the performance criteria are satisfied, share options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from
the date of grant.
Report on directors' remuneration continued
32 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomes.co.uk/plc Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan
A Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2000 Annual General Meeting. An amendment
to the rules of the Long Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and under the amended rules of the plan
at the date of this report a participant may receive in respect of any financial year a maximum award of shares with a market value, when the award is made,
not exceeding 100% of basic salary. Each award is made subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria and awards may only be exercised at
the end of three years. There is no cost to the participants in the plan to exercise the awards.
The extent to which the awards may be exercised is determined by two measures of performance; total shareholder return ( TSR') and earnings per share
( EPS') growth, each measured over a three year performance period and each relating to half of the shares awarded.
The TSR measure requires the comparison of the growth in the Company's TSR over a three year period to that of a group of comparator companies in the
housebuilding industry specified by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the performance period. TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and
dividends paid during the three year period (assuming that such dividends are reinvested in ordinary shares). For awards granted in 2006 the Company's
ranking amongst the comparator companies will be used to determine the percentage of the shares under the award which will vest, as follows:
TSR ranking % of total award which can be realised
1st position 50% of the shares in the award
2nd position 45% of the shares in the award
3rd position 37.5% of the shares in the award
4th position 30% of the shares in the award
5th position 20% of the shares in the award
6th position 15% of the shares in the award
Recognising the reduction in comparator companies and the lack of suitable replacements, the Remuneration Committee has determined that the
performance of companies acquired during the three year performance period applicable to the 2006 awards will from the date of acquisition be notionally
reinvested in the company which has the median TSR performance from the date of acquisition to the end of the performance period (excluding other
acquired companies), maintaining the number of comparator companies and the vesting schedule based on ranking for these awards.
The group of comparator companies to be used for the 2006 awards is as follows:
Comparator companies
Barratt Developments PLC The Berkeley Group plc George Wimpey PLC Redrow Group plc Westbury plc
Bellway p.l.c. Crest Nicholson PLC Persimmon plc Taylor Woodrow plc Wilson Bowden plc
During 2007 the Remuneration Committee carried out a review of the TSR measure and for awards granted from 2007 onwards it was revised from one
based on ranking to one operating on the basis of performance relative to the median over the three year performance period, as derived from the TSR
performance of the comparator companies. Measuring performance against the median was adopted in the context of a reducing comparator group, to
ensure a robust approach and one less prone to distortions and as being viable for smaller comparator groups. Vesting was revised as follows:
TSR performance % of total award which can be realised
Maximum TSR performance 50% of the shares in the award
Threshold TSR performance 15% of the shares in the award
Threshold TSR performance is set at the median compound growth in TSR of the comparator group and maximum TSR performance is set at median plus
15% per annum compound growth in TSR. Where TSR performance falls between the threshold and the maximum TSR performance, the percentage of
shares which can be realised will be calculated on a straight line sliding scale. Where TSR falls below median, none of the shares in the award judged by
reference to TSR can be realised.
The group of comparator companies for 2007 awards onwards is comprised as follows:
Comparator companies
Barratt Developments PLC The Berkeley Group plc Taylor Woodrow plc
Bellway p.l.c. Persimmon plc Redrow Group plc
The EPS growth measure was unaltered for awards granted in 2008, and is based on the extent to which the Company's average annual EPS growth over
the three year performance period falls between minimum and maximum EPS growth targets set by the Remuneration Committee as follows:
EPS growth % of total award which can be realised
Maximum EPS growth 50% of the shares in the award
Threshold EPS growth 20% of the shares in the award
For 2008 and prior awards, the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets are 4% and 10% per annum above RPI respectively. Where EPS growth falls
between the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets, the number of shares which can be realised will be determined on a straight line sliding scale.
Where EPS growth falls below 4% above RPI, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS growth can be realised.
Report on directors' remuneration continued
Bovis Homes Group PLC      33 Following a wide consultation with major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has considered what performance measure is appropriate in regards
to EPS growth for awards granted in 2009, and has set absolute levels of EPS to be achieved during the performance period. The minimum and maximum
EPS growth targets are 20p and 50p per share respectively, measured in the third year of the performance period. Again following consultation, awards
granted to executive directors in 2009 did not exceed 80% of basic salary.
The shares required to satisfy the awards have been purchased by the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust. The grant price of the awards is set as the market
value of the shares at the date of grant. The market value of the shares attributable to each director will be included in remuneration in the year in which
the awards are exercised. An award may only be exercised within six months of the realisation date, the realisation date being the date of notification from
the Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust that the award is realisable in whole or in part.
Performance graph
As required by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the following performance graph compares, over the last five financial years, the Total
Shareholder Return of an ordinary share held in Bovis Homes Group PLC against the Total Shareholder Return of the FTSE mid-250 index of which Bovis
Homes Group PLC is a constituent.
Service agreements and terms of appointment
In respect of each of the executive directors, the service agreements are rolling twelve month contracts with a twelve month notice period due from either
employer or employee.
In addition to their salaries, the executive directors are entitled to participate in the Bovis Homes' employee share schemes and the Long Term Incentive Plan,
and to be considered for a performance bonus, dependent on the achievement of targets set down annually by the Remuneration Committee. They are also
entitled to membership of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme as a senior executive where service began on or before 2001, membership of the defined
contribution pension plan where service began after 2001 and between 24 and 27 working days holiday per annum determined by length of service. 
The directors hold membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS). There are no specific provisions for
compensation on early termination.
The non-executive directors have entered into service agreements for their services which are established for periods up to three years duration based upon
the frequency of re-election to the Board with notice periods up to twelve months. The service agreements for the non-executive directors are available for
inspection on request to the Group Company Secretary. The fees for their services were last reviewed as follows:

Changes in the number of ordinary shares held arose from the exercise of share options and Long Term Incentive Plan awards, and investment during the
year in partnership shares through the HMRC approved Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan. There were no changes in the holdings of ordinary shares
of any of the directors between 31 December 2008 and 6 March 2009, other than the normal monthly investment in partnership shares through the Bovis
Homes Group Share Incentive Plan.
The directors' interests in share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on pages 37 to 38. There were no changes in the holdings
of share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan between 31 December 2008 and 6 March 2009. LTIP awards granted to Mr Malcolm Harris
whilst an executive director continue in force until the third anniversary of the award date and, should either of the two measures of performance be met,
the number of shares which can be realised will be reduced according to the proportion of the three year performance period following cessation of
employment, measured in complete months, relative to the three year performance period. Options outstanding for Mr Malcolm Harris as at his date 
of retirement remain in place for a period of 12 months, during which time they are capable of exercise if performance criteria are met, or otherwise lapse.
Share ownership guidelines
There exist guidelines for executive directors in respect of share ownership of Bovis Homes' shares. The Board expects executive directors benefiting from the
exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of share options to retain at least 50% of the net value derived from the exercise, after settling all
costs and income tax due, as shares. This guideline is expected to be applied until such time as the executive director holds shares with a market value equal
to current basic annual salary.

Executive director salaries were reviewed by the Remuneration Committee during the first half of 2008 ahead of the retirement of Mr Malcolm Harris, the
promotion of Mr David Ritchie and the reduction in executive directors from three to two. Appropriate external independent advice was received as part of
this review and changes were approved as follows:
Effective Salary on Promotional Experience Inflationary Salary on Change Percentage

The salary of Mr Malcolm Harris was not reviewed as a result of his retirement and appointment as non-executive Chairman with effect from 3 July 2008.
Mr David Ritchie became Chief Executive on 3 July 2008, having previously been Group Managing Director. As a result of this promotion, the Remuneration
Committee considered the level of salary appropriate to the position, which was determined by assessment of equivalent salaries of Chief Executives working
for other housebuilders and publicly listed companies, taking into account the relative level of experience and the Company's interest in supporting retention.
Aside from the promotional salary increase, no inflationary increase was awarded during 2008.
Mr Neil Cooper commenced as Group Finance Director on 2 January 2007 on a salary reflective of his relative experience in comparison to benchmark salaries
at other housebuilders and at other listed companies of a comparable size. At 1 July 2008 it was considered that Mr Cooper's experience had grown and his
capabilities in the role had developed and in the view of the Remuneration Committee, his performance had been strong. Against this background, the
Remuneration Committee formed the view that his salary stood a substantial way below a full market rate, which was not in the Company's interests in regard
to supporting retention. Accordingly, Mr Cooper's salary was reviewed and increased following analysis of equivalent positions in the UK listed housebuilding
sector, as well as by reference to similarly sized companies in the FTSE-250. His relative experience continued to be taken into account when assessing his
new salary level. The Remuneration Committee continues to view Mr Cooper's performance as strong. Versus FTSE-250 constituents, Mr Cooper's new base
salary is in line with the average for the lower quartile and 15% below the median salary for FTSE-250 constituents. Aside from this review, reflecting
developments in the role, no inflationary increase was awarded during 2008.
Subsequent to the 1 July 2008 review, the Company's annual salary review date was changed to 1 January each year. Salaries were reviewed on 1 January
2009 and a standard no rise  principle was adopted, with the result that there was no proposal requiring consideration by the Remuneration Committee in
respect of the executive directors. The next review will take place on 1 January 2010.
During 2008, the Company reviewed the level of fees paid to its non-executive directors, supported both by appropriate external independent advice and a
benchmarking exercise assessing the fees payable to non-executive directors in similar companies, comparable both in terms of sector and in terms of size.
As a result, fees payable to Mr Colin Holmes have been increased from  40,000 to  45,000, fees payable to Mrs Lesley MacDonagh have been increased
from  35,000 to  40,000 and fees payable to Mr John Warren were increased from  45,000 to  52,000 before reverting to  47,000 with the appointment
of Mr Alastair Lyons as the Senior Independent Director.
The gains for directors on the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards are shown on page 38.

Note 1: The accumulated total accrued pension as at 31 December 2007 has been adjusted for inflation in arriving at the increase in the accrued pension at 31 December 2008. 
The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase due to inflation.
Note 2: The transfer value has been calculated using the amended transfer basis introduced in October 2008 following a review by the trustee of all pension scheme member benefits.
There have been no changes to, or discretion applied to, transfer values arising from special individual arrangements. The values are shown net of directors' contributions.
Note 3: Mr Ritchie's pensionable earnings are restricted to an earnings cap (2008/09:  113,800) for pension accruals up to 5 April 2006. Pension benefits accrued after this date are
not subject to an earnings cap, but are subject to a cap on annual increases in pensionable earnings of 2.5%.
Note 4: Mr Harris began receiving his pension from 3 July 2008 upon his retirement from active service. The  accumulated total accrued pension as at 31 December 2008 reflects his
pre  commutation pension as at 3 July 2008. Mr Harris retired approximately 6 months into the year, however, the increase in accrued pension during the year (net of inflation)
is based on a full year of inflation. The transfer value of the increase (less director contributions) is based on his pension at 3 July 2008 but uses market conditions as at 31
December 2008.

The awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan in August 2008 were based on the increase in salaries of Mr David Ritchie and Mr Neil Cooper effective from
1 July 2008. These increases in salary are explained on page 36 and given their nature, the Remuneration Committee considered the additional awards appropriate.
Awards granted to Mr Malcolm Harris whilst an executive director continue in force until the third anniversary of the award date and, should either of the
two measures of performance be met, the number of shares which can be realised will be reduced according to the proportion of the three year performance
period following cessation of employment, measured in complete months, relative to the three year performance period.

Report on directors' remuneration continued
38 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomes.co.uk/plc The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements, in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent
Company financial statements on the same basis.
The Group and Parent Company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the Group
and the Parent Company and the performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in
the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
  for the Group and Parent Company financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent
Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a directors' report, report on directors' remuneration and report on
corporate governance that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in
the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
a) the Group and Parent Company financial statements in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRIC
interpretation and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and of the Group taken as a whole; and
b) the management report contained in this report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the
Company and the Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
