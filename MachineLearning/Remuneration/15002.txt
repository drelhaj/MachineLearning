1. Introduction
All matters relating to the remuneration of the executive directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee. The Committee, which is
chaired by Mr. M.J. Allen, is appointed by the Board and is composed of the Chairman and three non-executive directors; the quorum for the
valid transaction of business is three and no executive director has any right of attendance or membership. The principal objective of the
Remuneration Committee is to ensure that the executive directors and senior management are both highly motivated and fairly rewarded for
their contribution to the Group's overall performance having regard to the interests of the shareholders, the overall remuneration structure
within the Group and practices adopted by comparator companies.
When considering the remuneration of the directors, the Committee benchmarks the return to shareholders achieved by the company with
that of a comparator group comprising representative companies from the passenger transport and support services sectors.
The Committee is required to determine and agree with the Board, and keep under review, both the policy and the detailed elements of the
remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors. In formulating its policy the Committee will have due regard to the
practices adopted by the comparator group. As a result of the review of the work of the Board Committees, the remit of the Committee has
been extended to cover the tier of senior management immediately below Board level.
The remit of the Committee requires it to regularly review targets and benefits under any performance related pay arrangements to ensure that
they remain consistent with the long-term interests and expectations of the shareholders. Periodically the Committee will critically evaluate the
merits and effectiveness of performance related pay schemes as they affect the Board and senior management.
The Committee considers all elements comprising executive remuneration, including basic salary, performance related bonus, awards under
the company's Long Term Incentive Plan, pension provision, benefits in kind and service agreement terms. From 1 January 2000 directors'
bonuses have not been taken into account in computing pension benefits. With regard to the forthcoming statutory changes relating to
pension arrangements effective from 6 April 2006 work on possible options is being progressed.
In the case of the executive directors, the Committee takes independent advice from specialist consultants in developing its remuneration
policy and ensuring that the overall reward package remains competitive. It is the policy of the Committee that the benchmark for executive
directors' salaries should be the median of equivalent roles in comparable companies in the transport and support services sectors. With effect
from 1 January 2005, the base salaries of the executive directors were increased by 4 per cent.
The executive directors participate in a performance related bonus arrangement with bonus being paid on the attainment of specified targets
established by the Committee and agreed with the director. The Chief Executive is targeted on Group performance; the other executive
directors are targeted on Group, divisional (Messrs Clayton and Martin) and personal performances. The Group performance and divisional
performance elements are based on the achievement of targets for earnings per share and divisional profit; the personal performance
element is entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and is a qualitative element reflecting individual
performance against key personal objectives. The non-executive directors do not participate in any performance related pay arrangements.
Benefits in kind are awarded as the Committee considers appropriate and currently comprise company cars (or a cash allowance on a basis that
is cost neutral to the company), fuel, medical insurance and telephone costs.
The non-executive directors' fees are currently limited by the Articles of Association to  400,000 per annum in the aggregate and the Articles
permit the directors to increase this cap annually in line with the index of wage inflation. Within the aggregate cap the annual fee for each
non-executive director is determined by the Board, the non-executive directors taking no part in the deliberations. The fee payable to each
of the non-executive directors remained unaltered throughout the period under review.
Each of the non-executive directors is appointed for a fixed term not exceeding three years. The appointments are renewable with the
agreement of both parties again for terms not exceeding three years. Except in unusual circumstances, the maximum aggregate service
of a non-executive director will be limited to nine years.
Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which is subject to twelve months' notice. With the exception of Mr. S.P. Lonsdale,
all the executive directors have contracts dated 19 November 2001; Mr. S.P. Lonsdale's contract is dated 5 September 1997. Each of the
executive directors' service contracts contain an explicit provision for compensation payment on termination, except in the case of misconduct.
Where a director's service contract is terminated by the company, a severance payment will be made comprising the sum of:
(i) the director's basic annual salary at the time of notice; and
(ii) the performance related element estimated to be payable to the director in respect of the financial year in which notice is served; and
(iii) an amount representing the value of  benefits in kind' in the audited accounts of the company for the financial year immediately preceding
the date of termination.
In principle the Board will permit the executive directors to accept appointments outside the company. However before accepting such
appointments the director(s) involved must receive the prior written approval of the Board. In considering such cases the Board will always
satisfy itself, as far as is possible, that such appointments will not detract from the executive directors' expected contribution to the company,

nor that such appointment will create any conflict of interest. Any fees earned by an executive director in such a capacity will be assigned to
the company as in the case of Mr. R.J. Davies' appointment as a non-executive director of Barratt Developments PLC, where the annual fee
of  33,000 is paid directly to the company on a quarterly basis.

# The closing mid market price of the ordinary share on 31 December 2004 was 540.00p
The highest price achieved by the Arriva plc ordinary share in the year ended 31 December 2004 was 540.00p on 31 December 2004; the lowest
price of the Arriva plc ordinary share in the same period was 339.75p on 2 February 2004.
Mr. R.J. Davies has residual interests in two of the Group's discretionary share option schemes, the Executive Share Option Scheme and the
Share Incentive Scheme, both of which incorporate performance target requirements which must be achieved before the exercise of the share
option is permitted. The performance targets are set by the Remuneration Committee and may be varied from time to time. The current target
requires the company's earnings per share over a period of three consecutive years prior to any exercise to exceed the Retail Prices Index by a
minimum of 2 per cent p.a. i.e. 6 per cent over the three year period.
Following the introduction of The Long Term Incentive Plan in 2000, the executive directors ceased to be eligible to receive further grants of
options under the discretionary share option schemes.

Mr. A.M. Saxton 175,332 60,465 57,477 172,344
The conditional award of 57,477 shares made to Mr. A.M. Saxton on 8 March 2004 lapsed without compensation on 2 March 2005.
The performance measurement periods in respect of the conditional share awards comprising the interests of the directors under The LTIP at
the year end, and the market value of the ordinary share on the dates of the awards are as follows:
Award date Performance measurement period Market value at date of award
30 October 2002 Three years ending 31 December 2004 305.25p
6 March 2003 Three years ending 31 December 2005 302.00p
8 March 2004 Three years ending 31 December 2006 377.00p
The vesting of the conditionally awarded shares will depend upon the performance of the company's earnings per share when compared with
the growth in the Retail Prices Index and also of the Total Shareholder Return ( TSR') of the company when compared with the TSR of the
Peer Comparator Group (comprising the constituent companies of the FTSE 250, excluding investment companies) over a period of three
years. The vesting will be on a sliding scale of 25 per cent - 100 per cent and no share will vest unless the TSR of Arriva plc is at least equal
to the median TSR of the Peer Comparator Group, and that Arriva's earnings per share in the same period has exceeded the growth in the Retail
Prices Index by at least 6 per cent.
With regard to the conditional award made on 30 October 2002 the growth in the company's earnings per share over the three years ended
31 December 2004 increased by 49 per cent. Over the same period the company's Total Shareholder Return was 89.2 per cent, exceeding the
threshold for the upper quartile of the Peer Comparator Group by 17.8 percentage points.
As both performance conditions were met, the Remuneration Committee confirmed on 24 February 2005 that shares comprising the conditional
award made on 30 October 2002 and still subsisting at 31 December 2004 should vest in full on 3 March 2005.
The market price of an Arriva plc ordinary share on the date of vesting was as follows:
Market price on
Award date Date of vesting date of vesting (p)
2 May 2000 6 March 2003 302.00
9 March 2001 3 March 2004 377.25
30 October 2002 3 March 2005 546.00
5. Remuneration Report Approval
An ordinary resolution to consider, and if thought fit approve this Remuneration Report, will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
