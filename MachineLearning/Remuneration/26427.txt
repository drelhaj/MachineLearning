(a) The calculation of the number of ordinary shares used in the computation of basic earnings per share is the aggregate of the weighted average number  
of ordinary shares outstanding during the period of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc after deduction of the weighted average number of shares  
held by the Billiton share repurchase scheme and the Billiton Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust and the BHP Bonus Equity Plan Trust and adjusting for  
the BHP Billiton Limited bonus share issue. Included in the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share are shares contingently issuable under Employee  
Share Ownership Plans.
(b) Underlying EBIT is Profit from operations, excluding the effect of exceptional items. See section 3.6.2 for more information about this measure, including  
a reconciliation to Profit from operations.
(c) Underlying EBIT margin excludes third party product.
(d) On 1 July 201 0, the Group adopted the policy of classifying exploration cash flows which are not recognised as assets as Net operating cash flows.  
Previously such cash flows were classified as net investing cash flows. The change in policy arose from amendments to IAS7/AASB7  Cash Flows'.  
Comparative figures have been restated.
(e) Underlying EBIT margin and Return on capital employed are non-IFRS measures. See section 3.3 for a reconciliation to the corresponding IFRS measure.
