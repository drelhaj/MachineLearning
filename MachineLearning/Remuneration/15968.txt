 Directors' remuneration report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Directors' remuneration report for the 
year ended 30 April 2013.
In advance of the new regulations being issued by the Department  
for Business, Innovation and Skills ( BIS') for remuneration reporting, 
we have decided to restructure our remuneration report ahead of 
schedule this year. As well as this statement, you will find separate 
sections that set out our policy ( Remuneration policy') and how  
that policy has been implemented ( Implementation of the Group's 
remuneration policy'). We have worked to increase both the transparency 
and accessibility of our remuneration reporting. As ever, we would 
welcome our shareholders' feedback.
Over the past three years the Remuneration Committee has sought  
to structure a more balanced remuneration policy and to align 
directors' interests even more closely with those of shareholders.  
I believe the changes we have made have resulted in a better 
correlation between remuneration and performance and have 
contributed to our record performance.
Following consultation with our major shareholders the recent 
changes introduced were:
  an overhaul of the bonus scheme to reward exceptional 
performance and also the introduction of a deferral, forfeiture and 
clawback mechanism that aligns remuneration with shareholder 
interests; and
  a balanced and holistic approach to the Performance Share Plan, 
incorporating four performance measures, with the objective of:
   aligning remuneration with the key performance indicators of 
the business over the long term; and
   incentivising executive management appropriately throughout 
the economic cycle.
As you will have seen from the rest of this Annual Report and Accounts, 
performance at Ashtead has continued the trend of the last couple of 
years and has been particularly strong this year. We have continued  
to grow market share and expand margins in our core market of the 
US. As a result we have been one of the best performing stocks in the 
FTSE 250. This, combined with our record dividend again this year, 
means that total shareholder returns have been extremely good. 
Nonetheless, the business environment remains challenging and,  
as a cyclical business, Ashtead remains susceptible to changes in 
market conditions throughout the economic cycle. Our aim is to 
continue to take advantage of the structural change in the US market 
and continue to build market share. Building sustainable performance 
across economic cycles remains a key focus of our corporate strategy.
The Implementation Report includes a table for the new single 
remuneration figure for all directors for the year, as well as a 
summary table setting out our chief executive's remuneration over the 
past six years. Total remuneration has increased five-fold since 2008 
as a result of the strong financial performance of Ashtead, while total 
shareholder returns have increased ten-fold over the same period.  
In the last two years, we have seen a significant increase in total 
remuneration, a substantial element of which is a result of the full 
vesting of the 2009 and 2010 Performance Share Plan ( PSP') awards 
which were granted when the share price were 55.5p and 98.5p, 
respectively. We are pleased to note the strong correlation of 
remuneration policy with total shareholder returns. The alignment of 
remuneration policy with the interests of shareholders has been, and 
will continue to be, a key objective of the Remuneration Committee.
With effect from 1 May 2013, we have increased base salaries by 
between 3-10% for Group and Sunbelt employees in order to  
retain and incentivise our key staff and bring salaries into a more 
appropriate range for a company of our size and complexity. While  
our base salary levels remain generally lower than those of our  
peers, they are now more in line. A-Plant's base salaries are 
scheduled for review in November. In an inherently cyclical business 
we continue to believe that a larger variable element of pay is 
appropriate. The bonus plans and the Performance Share Plan will 
remain broadly unchanged this year although performance targets 
have been modified to reflect where we are in the cycle.

42 a shtead group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of  
the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts  
and Reports) Regulations 2008 ( the Regulations'). The report also 
meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the 
Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration.  
As required by the Regulations, an advisory resolution to approve  
the report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting of the Company.
The Regulations require the auditor to report to the Company's 
members on elements of the Directors' remuneration report and  
to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
The audited information is included on pages 50 to 53.
r emuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee  
( the Committee') in accordance with the recommendations of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee is comprised  
of independent non-executive directors. The members of the 
Committee are as follows:
Michael Burrow Chairman 
Hugh Etheridge  
Bruce Edwards  
Ian Sutcliffe 
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interests, 
other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. None of the 
members of the Remuneration Committee is currently or has been  
at any time one of the Company's executive directors or an employee. 
None of the executive directors currently serves, or has served, as a 
member of the board of directors of any other company which has one 
or more of its executive directors serving on the Company's Board or 
Remuneration Committee.
The Group's chief executive, Geoff Drabble, normally attends  
the meetings of the Committee to advise on operational aspects  
of the implementation of existing policies and policy proposals,  
except where his own remuneration is concerned, as does the 
non-executive chairman, Chris Cole. Eric Watkins acts as secretary  
to the Committee. Under Michael Burrow's direction, the company 
secretary and Geoff Drabble have responsibility for ensuring the 
Committee has the information relevant to its deliberations. 
In formulating its policies, the Committee has access to professional 
advice from outside the Company, as required, and to publicly 
available reports and statistics. The Committee appointed 
Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP ( PwC') to provide independent advice 
on various matters it considered. PwC was appointed in 2011 following 
an interview process by the Committee. PwC is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its code in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. PwC also provided 
internal audit and specific tax services to the Company during the 
year. The Committee is satisfied that neither the nature nor scope of 
these non-remuneration services by PwC impaired its independence 
as advisers to the Committee.
Main re SPon SiBili TieS of T he r eMunera Tion Co MMiTTee

An ordinary resolution concerning the Group's remuneration  
policies will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual  
General Meeting.
Ashtead is committed to ongoing shareholder dialogue and considers 
carefully voting outcomes. In the event of a substantial vote against a 
resolution in relation to directors' remuneration, Ashtead would seek 
to understand the reasons for any such vote and would detail any 
actions taken in response to it in the Directors' remuneration report

Link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Base salary The purpose of the base 
salary is to attract and retain 
directors of the high calibre 
needed to deliver the Group's 
strategy without paying  
more than is necessary  
to fill the role.
An executive director's basic salary is normally determined by 
the Committee annually. In deciding appropriate levels, the 
Committee considers the experience and performance of 
individuals and relationships across the Board and seeks to be 
competitive, but fair, using information drawn from both internal 
and external sources and taking account of pay and conditions 
elsewhere in the Company.
For the year 2013/14 the 
Group implemented a pay 
increase of 3-10% for Group 
and Sunbelt employees. 
A-Plant's salary review is 
scheduled for November.
Pension and  
benefits
The purpose of pension and 
benefits is to attract and 
retain directors of the high 
calibre needed to deliver  
the Group's strategy without 
paying more than is 
necessary to fill the role.
The executive directors' benefits include pension, medical 
insurance, life cover, car allowance and travel and 
accommodation allowances.
Executive directors have 
pension entitlements of 
between c.5% and 40%  
of base salary.
Deferred Bonus  
Plan ( DBP')
Participants 
Geoff Drabble
Brendan Horgan
Suzanne Wood
The purpose of the DBP is  
to incentivise executives to 
deliver stretching annual 
financial performance while 
aligning short-term and 
long-term reward through 
compulsory deferral of a 
proportion into share 
equivalents.
Alignment of executive and 
shareholder interests.
Stretching financial targets are set by the Committee at the start 
of each financial year. To achieve the maximum bonus potential 
in 2012/13, Group underlying profit before tax had to increase 
38% over the prior year's record profits and Sunbelt's underlying 
operating profit by 32%.
The DBP runs for consecutive three-year periods with a 
significant proportion of any earned bonus being compulsorily 
deferred into share equivalents. Based on achievement of annual 
performance targets, participants receive two-thirds (half in 
respect of the chief executive) of the combined total of their 
earned bonus for the current year and the value of any share 
equivalent awards brought forward from the previous year at the 
then share price. The other one-third (half in respect of the chief 
executive) is compulsorily deferred into a new award of share 
equivalents evaluated at the then share price.
Deferred share equivalents are subject to 50% forfeiture for 
each subsequent year of the plan period where performance 
falls below the forfeiture threshold set by the Committee.
At the expiration of each three-year period, participants will, 
subject to attainment of the performance conditions for that 
year, receive in cash their bonus for that year plus any brought 
forward deferral at its then value.
The DBP gives key members 
of the senior teams of Ashtead 
and Sunbelt the opportunity to 
earn an annual bonus of up to 
150% of base salary, except 
for the Group chief executive 
whose maximum opportunity 
is 200% for maximum 
performance.
No changes were made to the 
scheme during the year.
Annual  
performance  
bonus
Participant 
Sat Dhaiwal
The purpose of the annual 
performance bonus is to 
incentivise executives to 
deliver stretching annual 
financial performance.
Stretching financial targets are set by the Committee at the start 
of each financial year. To achieve maximum bonus potential in 
2012/13, A-Plant's underlying operating profit had to increase 
64% over the prior year.
The annual performance 
bonus gives key members  
of the senior team of A-Plant 
the opportunity to earn a 
maximum bonus of up to 
100% of base salary. This  
plan reflects the different 
remuneration environment  
in the UK plant hire industry.
No changes were made to the 
scheme during the year.
Performance  
Share Plan  
( PSP')
The purpose of the PSP is to 
attract, retain and incentivise 
executives to optimise 
business performance 
through the economic cycle, 
and hence build a stronger 
underlying business with 
sustainable long-term 
shareholder value creation.
This is an inherently cyclical 
business with high capital 
requirements. The 
performance conditions have 
been chosen to ensure that 
there is an appropriate 
dynamic tension between 
growing earnings, delivering 
strong RoI, whilst maintaining 
leverage discipline.
Performance is measured over a three-year period.
Awards are subject to continued employment and achievement 
of a range of balanced and holistic performance conditions that 
are maintained across the cycle. The performance criteria are 
total shareholder return (40%), earnings per share (25%), return 
on investment (25%) and leverage (10%).
Awards vest on a pro rata basis as follows:
The maximum PSP 
opportunity for 2012/13 was 
150% of base salary for Geoff 
Drabble and 100% of base 
salary for Suzanne Wood, 
Brendan Horgan and Sat 
Dhaiwal. No changes were 
made to the plan during  
the year.
The maximum PSP awards  
as a percentage of base salary 
will remain unchanged for 
2013/14.
Total shareholder return 
-  median to upper quartile performance against  
a comparator group of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding 
investment trusts
earnings per share 
- compound growth of 6-12% per annum
r eturn on investment

44 a shtead group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 The Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan, which was adopted in 2004, is a long-term incentive share award plan under which executive directors and other 
members of the senior management team may annually be awarded a conditional right to acquire shares, the vesting of which depends on the 
satisfaction of demanding performance conditions.
In recent years, the policy has been to grant awards of shares with a market value at the date of grant equal to between 20% and 100% of the 
participant's base salary with the executive directors typically receiving the upper end of this range and the Group chief executive receiving an 
award equivalent to 150% of his base salary as at the date of grant.
Share-ba Sed incen Tive S and dilu Tion limi TS
The Company observes an overall dilution limit of 10% in 10 years for all company share schemes, together with a limit of 5% in 10 years for 
discretionary schemes. No new shares have been issued by the Company in connection with executive share plans in recent years.
r emunera Tion P olicy on new hire S
In the event of hiring a new executive director, the Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy 
summarised above. However, the Committee retains the discretion to make remuneration proposals outside the standard policy to facilitate 
the recruitment of an individual of the calibre required to deliver the Group's strategy. In particular, it will consider compensating an incoming 
executive with the like-kind incentive arrangements for foregone incentives with their previous employer, taking into account the length of the 
period they were held and an assessment of the likely vesting value. The Committee will ensure that such arrangements are in the best 
interests of both the Company and the shareholders without paying more than is necessary.
c on Sul Ting wi Th Shareholder S
The Committee believes that it is important to maintain an open dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters.
The Committee consulted with major shareholders extensively during 2011/12 with regards to the introduction of the Deferred Bonus Plan  
and the balanced scorecard approach for the Performance Share Plan. The views of shareholders were integral to the changes introduced.
Looking forward, the Committee will continue to liaise with shareholders regarding material changes to remuneration arrangements.
ToTal remunera Tion o PPor TuniT y Our remuneration arrangements are designed so that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of short- and long-term 
objectives designed to create shareholder value.
The graphs below illustrate the potential future reward opportunity for each of the executive directors, based on the remuneration policy set

The executive directors are subject to shareholding obligations. They are required to retain no fewer than 50% of shares that vest under the

executive directors currently meet this guideline.

Ser ViCe Con Tra CTS an D exi T Pay Men TS
The Company's policy is that executive directors have rolling contracts which are terminable by either party giving the other 12 months' notice. 
The service contracts for each of the executive directors all contain non-compete provisions appropriate to their roles.
Director Date of service contract Notice period
Sat Dhaiwal 8 July 2002 12 months
Geoff Drabble 6 July 2006 12 months
Brendan Horgan 25 January 2011 12 months

Upon the termination of employment of any executive director any compensation will be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions 
of the director's employment contract and the rules of any incentive scheme.
Base pay and benefits The Company, if it chooses, may make a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to base salary and benefits for the 
notice period. Upon the termination of an executive director's employment for cause the Company is entitled to 
terminate the director's employment immediately without payment.
Bonus Executive directors may receive a prorated bonus based on achievement of performance objectives and the 
number of months' service during the year to the date of leaving.
Performance Share Plan Under the rules of the Performance Share Plan, if an executive director is classed as a good leaver (where  
his employment terminates by reason of, amongst other things, death, redundancy, retirement at normal 
retirement age or by agreement with the Company) any outstanding awards will be normally prorated for time 
and vest, subject to the attainment of the performance conditions attaching thereto, on or around the third 
anniversary of the grant date.
r eMunera Tion P oli Cy for non-exe CuTiVe Dire CTor S
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association. None of the 
non-executive directors has a service contract with the Company and their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.
The fees for the non-executive directors are as follows:

Chairman of Audit Committee Additional  5,000  10,000
Chairman of Remuneration Committee Additional  5,000  10,000
In a normal year non-executive directors are expected to attend six board meetings (with at least two being in the US) and where relevant, at 
least four/five Audit Committee, two Remuneration Committee and one Nomination Committee meetings. Additionally, non-executive directors 
are required to devote sufficient time to understand the business in general and the various board and committee papers circulated in advance 
of the meetings to enable them to make an informed and constructive contribution to the meetings.

(ii)  Sat Dhaiwal is a member of the Ashtead Group Retirement Benefits Plan. The amount shown above represents the increase in his accrued pension benefit calculated  
on the proposed BIS basis. This methodology differs from that prescribed by the occupational transfer value regulations and so the figure differs from that shown  
in the pension section on page 51. The amount for Geoff Drabble and Ian Robson represents a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions at 40% of salary. The 
amounts included for Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood represent the co-match under the Company's 401K defined contribution pension plan and 409A deferred 
compensation plan.
(iii)  Deferred Bonus Plan includes the cash received by each director from the DBP for 2012/13 performance as explained on page 44. This includes 50% of this year's total 
bonus earned by, and 50% of the brought forward deferred share equivalents for, Geoff Drabble and 67% of each for Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood. The balance 
for each director was compulsorily deferred into share equivalents as part of the DBP.
(iv)  Annual Performance Bonus represents the cash award under the Annual Performance Bonus plan for 2012/13 performance.
(v)  The vesting PSP value is calculated as the number of shares vesting, based on the vesting criteria, valued at the market value of those shares, plus the payment in  
lieu of dividends paid during the vesting period. Market value is the market value on the day the awards vest (if they vest before the date the financial statements are 
approved) or the average market value for the last three months of the financial year (if the awards vest after the date the financial statements are approved). The 2010 
award is expected to vest fully on 29 June 2013 and has been valued at an average market value of 557p for the three months ended 30 April 2013, plus 10p per share in 
lieu of dividends paid during the vesting period.
(vi)  Suzanne Wood was appointed a director on 16 July 2012 and her salary, benefits and pension are included from that date to 30 April 2013. The amount related to the DBP 
is the total amount due under the plan for 2012/13. The PSP figure represents the award for which the performance period completes on 28 June 2013.
The significant value attributable to the vesting of PSP awards within the single remuneration figure reflects the significant appreciation of the 
share price since the awards were granted. This is illustrated as follows:

b a Se Salary For the year 2013/14 the Group implemented a pay increase of 3 -10% for its Sunbelt and Group employees. Geoff Drabble and Brendan Horgan 
received a salary increase of 10% of base salary and Suzanne Wood received a salary increase of 7%. These increases were designed to bring 
salaries into a more appropriate range for a company of our size and complexity. While base salaries remain generally lower than those of our 
peers, they are now more in line. In an inherently cyclical business we continue to believe that a larger, variable element of pay is appropriate.
Salary with effect from 1 May 2013
Sat Dhaiwal  220,000
Geoff Drabble  533,500

direc Tor S' Pen Sion arrangemen TS
The Company makes a payment of 40% to Geoff Drabble's base salary in lieu of providing him with any pension arrangements. This was  
agreed prior to his joining the Company in 2006 and reflected the fact that he was leaving a generous defined benefit arrangement at his 
previous employer.
Sat Dhaiwal's pension benefits are provided entirely through the Retirement Benefits Plan. Further details are provided on page 51.
Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood are members of the Sunbelt 401K defined contribution pension plan and the 409A deferred compensation 
plan. Further details are provided on page 51.
48 a shtead g roup plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 The Deferre D Bonu S Plan
The performance targets for the Deferred Bonus Plan for the year were as follows:
Group pre-tax profit* Sunbelt operating profit* Bonus potential
Forfeiture  100m $248m Loss of 50% of 
previously 
deferred bonus
Threshold  130m $300m 10%
Target  160m $345m 50%
Maximum  182m $382m 100%
* Underlying profit.
The performance targets for Geoff Drabble and Suzanne Wood for the year to 30 April 2013 related directly to the underlying pre-tax profits of 
Ashtead Group and for Brendan Horgan, underlying operating profit of Sunbelt Rentals. The targets set by the Committee for full entitlement 
under the DBP were significantly ahead of both prior year ( 131m) and consensus market expectation of  144m when the target was set. The 
target for Sunbelt Rentals was significantly ahead of the prior year ($290m). For the year to 30 April 2013, the underlying pre-tax profit for 
Ashtead Group was  247m and underlying operating profit for Sunbelt Rentals was $453m. As a result, the maximum bonus entitlements  
were earned and were equivalent to 200% of base salary for Geoff Drabble and 150% of base salary for Suzanne Wood and Brendan Horgan.
In 2013/14 Geoff Drabble, Suzanne Wood and Brendan Horgan will participate in the DBP. The targets for Geoff Drabble and Suzanne Wood  
will be linked to the Group's underlying pre-tax profits and those for Brendan Horgan will relate to Sunbelt's underlying operating profit.  
These performance targets should be viewed in conjunction with the wider performance targets set for the 2013/14 PSP awards as detailed  
on page 44.
The a nnual Perfor Man Ce Bonu S
The performance targets for the annual performance bonus were as follows:
A-Plant operating profit* Bonus potential
Threshold  8m 20%
Target  10m 50%
Maximum  12m 100%
* Underlying profit.
The maximum bonus entitlement for Sat Dhaiwal was 100% of base salary and related directly to the profitability of A-Plant. The target for 
maximum payout was significantly ahead of the prior year profit of  7.3m. A-Plant's underlying operating profit was  12.2m and, as a result, 
the maximum bonus entitlement was earned equivalent to 100% of base salary.
The Perfor Man Ce Share Plan
The performance criteria have varied by year in prior years. Following consultation with shareholders, a balanced and holistic approach  
was adopted involving four performance measures selected because delivery of them through the cycle is a significant challenge and the 
achievement of them will deliver optimum sustainable performance over the long term. The performance criteria for the award years  
affected by this year's performance are as follows:
Performance criteria (measured over three years)

For performance between the lower and upper target ranges, vesting of the award is scaled on a straight-line basis.
The 2009 PSP award vested in full on 13 July 2008 with EPS for 2011/12 of 17.3p exceeding the upper target of 13.6p and the Company's  
TSR performance ranked it first within the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts).
The 2010 PSP award, for which the performance period completes on 28 June 2013, is expected to vest in full. EPS for 2012/13 of 31.6p  
exceeds the upper target of 2.5p and at 12 June 2013, the Company's TSR performance ranked it first within the FTSE 250 (excluding 
investment trusts).
EPS is based on the profit before exceptional items, fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquired intangibles less the tax charge 
included in the accounts. The Committee considers it most appropriate to measure TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 (excluding 
investment trusts) rather than a specific comparator group of companies because there are few direct comparators to the Company listed in 
London and because the Company is a FTSE 250 company. The Company's TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 (excluding investment 
trusts) is shown on page 48.

Under the terms of his contract, Ian was entitled to draw a pension equal to one-thirtieth of his final salary for each year of pensionable service, 
but without deduction for early payment, from retirement on 13 July 2012. Accordingly, he is receiving a retirement allowance of  118,000 per
