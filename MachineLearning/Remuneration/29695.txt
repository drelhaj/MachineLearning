this section of the annual report and accounts describes the role and composition of the remuneration committee established by 
the Board (the  committee'), the company's remuneration policy and the arrangements currently in place for remuneration of both 
executive and non-executive Directors. 
Unaudited Information
The Remuneration Committee
Membership 
the committee from 27 March 2009 until 27 May 2009 comprised lord Bilimoria (chairman) and andrew cripps. From 27 May  2009 
onwards richard Farr joined the committee following his appointment as a non-executive Director. all members of the committee 
are considered to be independent non-executive Directors. charles Wilson, chief executive, attends committee meetings by 
invitation. Details of attendance at committee meetings are set out on page 12. 
Role of the Committee 
the committee advises the Board and makes recommendations to it about all elements of the remuneration packages of the 
executive Directors including remuneration, incentives and other benefits. It also recommends the terms of service contracts with 
executive Directors and any compensation arrangements resulting from the termination by the company of an executive Director's 
service contract. the committee also makes recommendations concerning the grant of shares and share options. 
the committee's responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference, which are published on the Group's website.
In determining remuneration, the committee consults where appropriate with the chief executive about its proposals. no 
Director participates in discussions about his own remuneration. no external consultants were engaged in relation to the design 
of remuneration packages during the year. When setting its remuneration policy, the committee gives due consideration to the 
provisions and principles of the code.
Remuneration policy 
the company wishes to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior management of the requisite quality. accordingly, 
its policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which, through an appropriate combination of basic salary 
and bonus, reward executive Directors and senior management fairly for their individual contribution. In determining remuneration, 
consideration is given to reward levels throughout the organisation as well as in the external employment market. the committee's 
overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages. 
the committee, having reviewed the equity incentives it had in place, established in July 2008 a savings-related share option scheme 
(the  sa Ye'), as approved by HM revenue & customs, which was offered to all employees within the Group, and a performance share 
plan (the  psp') also in July 2008, which was extended on a discretionary basis to certain employees only. certain information relating 
to the sa Ye and psp were set out in the remuneration report contained in the company's 2008 annual report and accounts which 
was approved by shareholders at the company's annual General Meeting in 2008. under the psp , employees selected to participate 
are entitled to acquire ordinary shares for no payment at the end of a vesting period (which will normally be 2 to 3 years). the company 
has made awards under the psp in relation to a total of 36 million new ordinary shares. the Directors believe that the best indicator 
of performance of this company and its directors is its share price performance. Vesting is subject to continued employment and the 
requirement that the company's share price be equal to or exceed certain share price targets for 60 consecutive days ending on or 
before the relevant vesting date. In certain circumstances, however, a proportion of awards may vest early. as at the 26 March 2010, 
three of the four share price targets had been met. consequently, half of the shares will vest in July 2010, with at least a further quarter 
vesting in July 2011, subject to continued employment at the dates of vesting. Details of awards made to the executive Directors under 
these plans are set out later in this report. options under the sa Ye are exercisable three years from the commencement of the relevant 
savings contract and not more than six months thereafter. these incentive arrangements reward participants if shareholder value is 
created, thereby aligning the interests of executive Directors, senior management and employees with those of shareholders. no psp's 
were awarded to Directors during the year ended 26 March 2010.

Executive Directors' remuneration 
the remuneration package of the executive Directors includes the following elements: 
Basic salary  	
Details of the Directors' remuneration are set out on page 21. salaries are normally reviewed annually and any changes are 
effective from 1 april, although no changes were made to salaries effective from 1 april 2009. salaries effective from 1 april 2010, 
but pending a review later in the 2010 calendar year, are set out on page 19. 
Bonus  	
payments under the annual scheme are based upon the achievement of budgeted profit targets for the Group. Jonathan prentis, 
Bryan Drew, Bryn satherley and Mark aylwin have each been awarded a bonus as set out on page 21. charles Wilson, chief 
executive, does not participate in the scheme.
Share incentives  	
the executive Directors are entitled to participate in the psp and the sa Ye.
Pensions  	
all executive Directors are entitled to a pension contribution at the rate of 15% of pensionable pay to be paid into their own 
personal pension arrangement or the Group personal pension plan, open to all of its permanent employees. pensionable pay 
is set at prior year's basic salary. Details of pension contributions in relation to the executive Directors are set out in the table on 
page 21.
Other benefits  	
Benefits for executive Directors principally comprise critical illness cover and permanent health cover. all executive Directors are 
also entitled to a car (or car allowance), life cover of four times basic salary and private medical insurance for themselves and 
their families. 
External appointments 
executive Directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices of other fully listed or aIM listed companies and, 
accordingly, no executive Director serves as a non-executive Director of any other company.
Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment
the non-executive Directors are paid a fixed fee and have letters of appointment for an initial period of 3 years subject to 
termination on one month's notice by the relevant Director or the company. these appointments are also subject to the articles 
of association of the company. the table below summarises the dates of appointment and most recent re-election dates for the 
chairman and each of the non-executive Directors serving at 26 March 2010.

the fees for the non-executive Directors are determined by the Board and reviewed from time to time having regard to the level 
of fees paid to non-executive Directors of comparator companies and reflect the individual commitments of the non-executive 
Directors to the Board and to the Board's committees. the non-executive Directors are not involved in any discussions or 
decisions about their own remuneration. 
the non-executive Directors do not receive bonuses or pension contributions and are not entitled to participate in any of the 
company's share schemes. they are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their 
duties as Directors of the company.

Executive Directors' service contracts
the Board's policy is that service contracts of executive Directors should provide for termination by the company on twelve 
months' notice. the service contracts of each of the current executive Directors provide for such a period of notice. none of the 
contracts provides for specific contractual termination payments other than payment in lieu of notice.
the company's policy on the termination of contracts of service of executive Directors is dictated by the events, bearing in mind 
the circumstances of termination and the interests of the company. the table below summarises the service contracts of the 
executive Directors.
copies of the service contracts will be available for inspection at the company's registered office during business hours and at

no consideration was paid to or became receivable by third parties for making available the services of any person as a Director

Terms of appointment

multiple of three, the number nearest to, but not exceeding, one third) of Directors, excluding those Directors appointed since the 
last annual General Meeting, are required to retire and may stand for re-election. In addition, all Directors appointed during the year 
must retire at the annual General Meeting and may offer themselves for re-election. Mark aylwin, having been appointed during 
the year, will therefore retire at the annual General Meeting and offer himself for re-election. lord Bilimoria, andrew cripps and 
Jonathan prentis will retire by rotation at the annual General Meeting, and being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election. 20

Directors' Share Interests 
the beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the company of Directors who held office at the end of the financial year are set 
out in the Directors' report.
Performance Graph
the company's performance from June 2007 to March 2010 measured by t otal shareholder return (tsr ), is compared in the 
chart below with the performance of the Ftse 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) and Ftse aIM all share Index. these are 
considered the most appropriate indices against which to measure performance following the reverse acquisition of Blueheath 
Holdings plc in June 2007, which was at that time listed on aIM, the company's admission to listing on the official list and to 
trading on the london stock exchange plc's main market for listed securities in July 2009 and its inclusion in the Ftse 250 Index 
in December 2009. 
tsr is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over 
a period of time. assuming dividends are reinvested into the company's shares, it measures the percentage growth in the 
company's share price together with any dividends paid.
