This report has been prepared in accordance with Section 234B of the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant requirements of 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority (together the Regulations ). The report also describes how the Board has 
applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to 
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements of the 
Company will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' remuneration 
report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 (as amended). The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration committee 
The Remuneration Committee's principal responsibility is to determine the remuneration of both the Company's executive 
Directors and its senior management within broad policies agreed with the Board. In addition, it reviews the remuneration policy 
for the Company as a whole. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the executive Directors, not the 
Committee. Copies of the Remuneration Committee terms of reference are available on request from the Company's registered 
office during business hours.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Committee were finalised in two formal meetings during the year, but these were 
preceded by several informal discussions, including some with advisers. The members of the Committee were David Mann 
(Chairman), Colin Garrett and (for part of the year) Nick Prest.
Nick Prest was appointed to the Remuneration Committee on his appointment to the Board on 11 January 2006 and he resigned 
from the Committee on 14 July 2006 in adherence with the Code provisions on independence which were in force at that time. 
The amendments made to the Combined Code in 2006 now permit the Chairman of the Board to be a member of the Remuneration 
Committee. The Chief Executive (Richard Longdon) is invited to submit recommendations to the Committee and both he and the 
members of the Committee take into consideration relevant external market data as well as the reviews of remuneration for 
employees of the Group generally.
Remuneration policy 
The Committee aims to ensure that members of the executive management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage 
enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of 
the Company. It also aims for a combination of fixed and variable payments, benefits and share-based awards that will achieve 
a balance in incentives to achieve short and long-term goals.
During the year the Remuneration Committee engaged New Bridge Street Consultants to review the remuneration of the 
executive Directors and senior management and to benchmark their remuneration against comparable companies. Based on 
the information provided by New Bridge Street Consultants, the Remuneration Committee made a recommendation, which the 
Board wishes to implement, concerning the introduction of a new short-term incentive plan for executive Directors and senior 
management. Subject to the achievement of performance conditions, the plan would reward the recipient partly in cash and 
partly in shares or share equivalents. The recipient would gain access to the shares or share equivalents in 3 equal tranches 
over a 3 year period, starting one year after the initial award. The Board believes that this incentive scheme more closely aligns 
the interests of executive Directors and senior management with shareholders' interests.
The AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option and Employee Share Option schemes originally introduced in 1996 have now expired. 
By a special resolution proposed for this year's Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 July 2007 , the Board is therefore seeking 
shareholder approval to replace them with a new share option scheme. Details of the new scheme are included in the enclosed 
Annual General Meeting notice.
Basic salaries
In determining the basic salary of each executive Director the Committee takes account of the performance of the Company as 
a whole and the performance of the individual in achieving financial and non-financial goals within his areas of responsibility.
Bonus payments
The executive Directors participate in annual performance-related bonus schemes determined by the Committee. The schemes are 
based substantially or entirely on the performance of the Company as a whole; part may be based on the achievement of personal 
objectives. Bonuses payable in the year to 31 March 2007 amounted to Richard Longdon  275,100 (2006 -  157 ,000) and 
Paul Taylor  183,500 (2006 -  102,000). For the year ended 31 March 2007 there was a cap on the bonus that an executive 
Director could earn under the scheme and the maximum payable was 100% of basic salary.

Total shareholder return performance graph
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the presentation of a performance graph of total shareholder 
return compared with a broad equity market index for a period of 5 years. The following graph shows the Company's performance, 
measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the techMARK All Share Index. Total shareholder return 
is the share price plus dividends reinvested compared against techMARK All Share Index, rebased to the start of the period. 
Total shareholder return v techMARK All Share Index 2002 - 2007
The Directors consider the techMARK All Share Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index includes the Group.
Share awards
The Committee considers that periodic grants of share-related incentives should constitute an important element of the 
remuneration of the Company's senior executives, in line with common practice in comparator companies. The Company's share 
schemes have therefore been used to provide long-term incentives to assist in creating and sustaining growth in share value. 
There have been 2 schemes in existence, the AVEVA Group plc Long-Term Incentive Scheme and the AVEVA Group plc Executive 
Share Option Scheme. The number of shares which may be allocated on exercise of any options granted under any of the 
Company's share option schemes (including employee schemes) shall not, when aggregated with the number of shares which 
have been allocated in the previous 10 years under these schemes, exceed 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company 
in issue immediately prior to that date. Details of the awards made under these schemes are as follows: 
Pre-2004 awards
The AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option scheme was established in 1996 at the time of the Company's listing on the Official 
List of the London Stock Exchange. Options awarded under this scheme prior to 2004 are subject to performance conditions, 
which require earnings per share to outperform Retail Price Index (utilisation) (RPI) by a total of 10% over a 3 year rolling 
period. These conditions were consistent with performance conditions commonly used at that time. 
2004 awards
In 2004 the Remuneration Committee commissioned a study by Deloitte & Touche LLP to review the Company's share options 
schemes and to make recommendations on their development. The Board accepted those recommendations and, following 
consultation with shareholders, the Company established the AVEVA Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP ) which was 
approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting held in 2004. Under the LTIP options are granted to selected individuals to 
acquire ordinary shares at an exercise price equal to the nominal value of the shares; these options will be exercisable only 
if stringent performance criteria are met.
At the Extraordinary General Meeting in 2004, shareholders also approved that the dilutions limits under the AVEVA Group plc 
Executive Share Option scheme be extended to enable further awards to be made under this scheme.

_1_AVV_ar07_back.indd   8 07/06/2007   13:54:23 In 2004, a total of 63,000 options were awarded to executive Directors under the new LTIP. The condition of exercise for these 
awards is based on the ranking of the Company in terms of its total shareholder return measured against the techMARK 100 index. 
The option will  vest' in accordance with the following scale:
Total shareholder return ranking Percentage vesting of shares subject to option
75% and above 100%
Median to 75% Pro rata on a straight line basis
Median 33%
Below median Nil
The performance conditions will be measured 3 years from the date of grant. There will be no retesting of the condition 
of exercise. 
2005 awards
In 2005, a total of 162,816 options under the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option scheme were awarded to executive 
Directors. The Remuneration Committee felt that awards made as market value options were better suited at that time to the 
Company's circumstances.
The performance conditions required to be achieved for the exercise of the option would be that Earnings per Share (EPS) in 
the financial year ending 31 March 2008 would have grown to no less than 5% above the Retail Price Index per annum from 
that achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2005. The performance condition was judged to be appropriately stretching 
because of the investment planned in the VNET programme during the period.
2006 awards
In 2006 a total of 42,588 share options were awarded to the executive Directors under the LTIP. The Committee decided to 
revert to this scheme, with performance conditions based on growth in earnings per share, but in this case the average growth 
in earnings per share achieved over the 3 years from 2006-07 to 2008-09. If average earnings per share growth is greater than 
15% per annum then all of the shares shall vest. If average earnings per share growth is less than 7.5% per annum none of the 
shares shall vest. If average earnings per share growth is between 7.5% and 15% then the number of shares that shall vest will 
be determined by linear interpolation. The Remuneration Committee considered that these were challenging performance 
conditions in the context of the Company's budget and market expectations at the time of the awards.
Service contracts
The service contracts and letters of appointment of the Directors include the following terms:
   Date of contract Date of appointment Notice period (months)
Nick Prest   10 January 2006 11 January 2006 3
David Mann   17 May 2000 8 June 1999 3
Colin Garrett   14 July 2000 1 August 2000 3
Richard Longdon   28 November 1996 28 November 1996 12
Paul Taylor   17 October 1989 1 March 2001 9
The Committee considers that the notice periods of the executive Directors are in line with those in other companies of a similar 
size and nature and are in the best interests of the Group to ensure stability in senior management. The Non-executive and 
executive Directors retire at any Annual General Meeting where they are so required by the Articles of Association. 
There are no predetermined special provisions for executive or Non-executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event 
of loss of office. The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for considering the circumstances of the early termination 
and in exceptional circumstances will determine compensation payments in excess of the Company's contractual obligations.

The market price as at 31 March 2007 was  8.19 with a high-low spread for the year of  3.06 to  9.85. 
During the year Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor exercised 300,000 and 213,000 options at an exercise price of 174.9p. The 
market price on the date of exercise was  7.20, which resulted in an aggregate gain on exercise of options for the year ended 
31 March 2007 of  2,796,363 (2006 -  nil). At the same time, Richard Longdon sold a total of 521,428 ordinary shares (of which 
221,428 ordinary shares were already owned) at a price of  7.20 and at 31 March 2007 held options over 160,293 ordinary shares 
and held 500,000 ordinary shares. Paul Taylor also sold 187 ,000 ordinary shares (of which nil were already owned) at  7.20 and 
at 31 March 2007 held options over 108,111 ordinary shares and held 50,000 ordinary shares.
The options are normally exercisable in full or in part between the 3rd and 7th anniversaries of the date of grant. Details of the 
performance conditions of share option awards are set out on pages 30 and 31.
Pensions
During the year, two Directors, (Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor) were members of AVEVA Solutions Limited's defined benefit 
pension scheme. It is a contributory, funded, occupational pension scheme registered with HMRC and since 1 October 2004 
Career Average Revalued Earnings benefits apply. Under this scheme they are entitled to a pension on normal retirement, or 
on retirement due to ill health, equivalent to 2/3rds of their pensionable salary provided they have completed (or would have 
completed in the case of ill-health) 25 years' service. A pension earnings cap (in line with historic Inland Revenue's earning 
cap) applies to Paul Taylor when calculating pensionable salary. Similarly, a scheme-specific earnings limit applies to the 
benefits earned by Richard Longdon. A lower pension is payable on earlier retirement after the age of 50 by agreement with the 
Company. Pensions are payable to dependants on the Directors' death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs 
in service. No other Directors were members of a pension scheme during the year (2006 - none).
