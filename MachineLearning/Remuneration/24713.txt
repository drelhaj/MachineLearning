Remuneration Committee report
Background
This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, (the regulations ). The auditors
are required to report on the auditable  part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the regulations). The report is therefore divided into separate
sections for audited and unaudited information.
The Board has reviewed the Group's compliance with the Combined Code (the Code ) on remuneration related matters. It is the opinion
of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.
Part 2 of the regulations - Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises Mrs Victoria Mitchell (Chairman), Mr David Howell, Mr Tony Palmer and 
Mr Alan Coppin (who was appointed to the Committee on 1 September 2006) all of whom are Non-executive Directors and independent.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no
potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role described. A copy of the
terms of reference can be downloaded from the Company's website. During the year in question the Remuneration Committee formally
met twice.
The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year and continues to be advised by Halliwell Consulting, an independent executive
compensation and share scheme consultancy. No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
In determining the Executive Directors' remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the Group Managing Director,
Mr A W Pidgley and the Group Finance Director, Mr R C Perrins. No Director played a part in any discussion about his remuneration.
Mr Roger Lewis acts as a director of Saad Berkeley Investments Limited, a joint venture between the Company and Saad Investments
Company Limited, for which he receives a fee of  10,000 per annum which he retains. In addition, Mr Lewis was appointed a non-executive
director of CNMI Limited on 20 October 2006, for which he receives a fee of  25,000 per annum which he retains.
Remuneration policy overview
The objective of the remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives. The Remuneration Committee believes
that shareholders' interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on performance-related pay. Emphasis on
performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy. It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee
that the policy provides meaningful incentives to Executives and ensures that the appropriate balance between fixed and performance
related compensation is maintained.
The Remuneration Committee reviews on an annual basis whether its remuneration policy remains appropriate for the relevant financial
year. Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include:
 
market conditions affecting the Company;
 
the recruitment market in the Company's sector;
 
changing market practice;
 
changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
The Company's current long-term incentive for the Executive Directors is provided through The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (see later in the report for full details). This Plan provided for one grant on its adoption with the release of
awards subject to the return to shareholders of  12 per share by 31 January 2011. Therefore the performance criteria and release
schedules were fixed on the date of grant. However, the Committee does formally review the operation of the Plan on a regular basis 
to ensure it remains appropriate to the Company's current circumstances and prospects.
Policy for year ended 30 April 2007 and year ending 30 April 2008
The policy is to set the main elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration package against the Company's comparator group as follows:
Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in kind Share incentives
Upper decile Upper decile Lower quartile to median Market practice Upper decile Remuneration Committee report continued
34 www.berkeleygroup.co.uk
For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Remuneration Committee used the following comparator group of companies, the
Company's principal industry peers, in the year ended 30 April 2007:
Company name
Amec plc Carillion Plc McCarthy & Stone Plc Westbury Plc
Balfour Beatty Plc Crest Nicholson Plc Persimmon Plc Wilson Bowden Plc
Barratt Developments Plc George Wimpey Plc Redrow Plc  
Bellway Plc Marshalls Plc Taylor Woodrow Plc
Bovis Homes Group Plc McAlpine (Alfred) Plc Travis Perkins Plc
It is the intention of the Remuneration Committee to use the same basis for the comparator group for the year ending 30 April 2008 with
the following adjustments to its constituents resulting from corporate activity during the year:
 
Crest Nicholson and McCarthy & Stone have been taken private and therefore are excluded on an ongoing basis;
 
Westbury was taken over by Persimmon Plc and Wilson Bowden was taken over by Barratt Developments plc and therefore the acquired
companies are excluded on an ongoing basis.
 
George Wimpey plc and Taylor Woodrow plc have merged and will be included as Taylor Wimpey plc on an ongoing basis.
Balance between fixed and variable performance based pay
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance based pay for each Executive Director for the year
ended 30 April 2007:
The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described below.
Elements of Executive Directors' Remuneration
Basic salary
Policy: Upper decile 
Year ended 30 April 2007
There was one salary rise amongst the Executive Directors during this financial year with the salary for the Group Finance Director being
increased from  325,000 to  350,000. As stated in last year's report the Remuneration Committee felt that this rise was appropriate
taking into account the policy set out below.
Policy
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that the salaries of the Executive Directors should be set at the upper decile in line with
the Committee's view that the Company has one of the most experienced Executive teams within the sector. When determining the
salaries of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration:
 
the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size
and complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group;
 
the performance of the individual Executive Director; 
 
the individual Executive Director's experience and responsibilities; and
 
the pay and conditions throughout the Company.

The Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in May 2007, and felt that in general, applying the above
policy, salary rises of between 5-7.5% were appropriate for the Executive Directors. However, the Executive Directors believed that the current
balance of the remuneration package was appropriate at this point and the salary recommendations were therefore not implemented.

Annual performance related bonus
Policy: Upper decile bonus potential
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to set the maximum annual bonus potential at the upper decile in relation to the
comparator group. Bonus payments are not pensionable.
General
The theoretical maximum bonus available is 300% of salary. However, the Remuneration Committee will only in very exceptional
circumstances, outside the normal operation of the bonus plan for the year in question, consider a bonus payment greater than 200% of
salary. On the occurrence of very exceptional circumstances and prior to any commitment to make a bonus payment, the Remuneration
Committee would consult shareholders to obtain their agreement that the circumstances gave rise to the level of bonus payment
proposed. Therefore the effective maximum annual bonus potential is 200% of salary. The maximum bonus potential and the effective
maximum bonus potential remain the same for the financial year ending 30 April 2008 i.e. 200%.
Bonus targets are reviewed each year and agreed by the Remuneration Committee. The performance measures for the Executive Directors'
bonus plan are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and
position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging.
The structure of bonus payments is as follows.
Position Percentage cash Percentage Units
Executive Bonus will be paid in cash up to a Any bonus payment above 100% of salary 
maximum of 100% of salary. will be invested, net of tax, in Units. These 
Units will be retained by the Executives for
18 months.
Year ended 30 April 2007
The targets for the year ended 30 April 2007, their level of achievement and the corresponding bonus earned for the Executive Directors
are set out in the following tables.
Bonus potential and targets for year ended 30 April 2007 and year ending 30 April 2008
The following table shows the maximum bonus potential for each of the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 April 2007 and the year
ending 30 April 2008. In addition, the table shows the percentage of that maximum bonus potential subject to each performance target

Bonus performance criteria
Cash redemption condition 
This performance condition applies to 100% of the maximum bonus potential for the Group Executive Directors and 25% of the 
maximum bonus potential for the Divisional Executive Directors.
For the financial years ending 30 April 2009 and 2011, the cash redemption condition requires the returns of capital of  2 and 
 3 per Unit respectively.
For years ending 30 April 2008 and 2010, the cash redemption condition will be met if the dividend lock up tests
(1)
are satisfied at the
end of the relevant financial year (six months earlier than required). If these tests are satisfied it means that the Company is on target 
to be able to make the redemption payments on the due dates. If the dividend lock up tests are not achieved at the end of the relevant
financial year but the Board is of the view that they will be satisfied in time to make the next redemption payment on the relevant date,
this element of the bonus will be accrued and not declared until the redemption payment has been made. In the highly unlikely event 
that a bonus is paid but the due redemption payment is not made the share element of the bonus paid shall be forfeited and the cash
element paid shall be offset against future bonus entitlements.
The year ended 30 April 2007 saw the scheduled redemption of the 2006 B share, and, accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has
agreed the bonus payments set out above in respect of the year ended 30 April 2007.
Divisional PBT performance condition
The divisional PBT targets are set at the beginning of the financial year at a level which is challenging taking into account the potential
level of bonus payments, the market, development availability and other relevant issues. The Remuneration Committee confirms that the
annual bonus payments set out within this report for the Divisional Executive Directors are appropriate taking into account the level of
profit achieved and the targets set at the beginning of the year ended 30 April 2007.
Share incentives
Policy: Upper decile
Overview
Executive Directors
The only Executive share incentive plan operated by the Company is The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) Long-Term Incentive Plan
(the 2004(b) LTIP ) approved by shareholders at the AGM on 17 September 2004.
The Executive Directors, excluding the Executive Chairman, in accordance with the rules of the 2004(b) LTIP were granted one award on
the adoption of the Plan. Therefore, no awards have been granted to the Executive Directors during the financial year ended 30 April 2007
under the 2004(b) LTIP or any other share based arrangement. Further, no awards will be made under the 2004(b) LTIP or any other
share based arrangement during the financial year ending 30 April 2008.
Other senior employees of the Company
The Company's business is broken down into a number of operating Divisions. The Remuneration Committee in conjunction with the Board
has, therefore, implemented both annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for other senior employees of the
Company linked to the performance of the relevant Division for which they work. Some elements of the cash bonus plans are annual,
whilst other elements are deferred to ensure long-term consistent delivery by each Division. The Remuneration Committee, in line with
best practice, continually reviews with the Board the policy behind the compensation plans at this level in the Company to ensure they
remain appropriate to the market and the Company's current circumstances. It is the view of both the Committee and the Board as a
whole that these arrangements are very effective at ensuring the delivery of Divisional performance for which these senior employees are
responsible. Both the Remuneration Committee and the Board believe that having senior employees focused on the delivery of Divisional
results is an excellent way of driving shareholder value.
(1) The dividend lock up tests are the additional financial ratio tests set out in the Group's banking facilities that must be satisfied for the Company to make a redemption payment. These tests
are more stringent than the ongoing financial covenant tests applicable to the Company's bank facilities. www.berkeleygroup.co.uk 37
2004(b) LTIP main features
The Plan provides Executive Directors, excluding the Executive Chairman, with rights to receive, at no cost, the shares set out in the table
below. The number of shares awarded under the Plan was determined on 26 October 2004, the date of the Scheme of Arrangement, as
15% of the fully diluted share capital of the Company on adoption of the 2004(b) LTIP . The shares will only be released to the Executive
Directors if the Company has returned to shareholders  12 per share by 31 January 2011 i.e. the end of the holding period. Fifty percent
of the shares subject to awards will be retained by the Executive Directors for a period of at least 12 months after the date of release,
with the balance retained for a period of at least 24 months following release.
The following table sets out the awards made under the 2004(b) LTIP to the Executive Directors:
Name Ordinary shares 
A W Pidgley 11,371,393
R C Perrins 4,264,272
A Carey 3,553,560
G J Fry 2,132,136
The Remuneration Committee's policy is designed to incentivise the Executive Directors to maximise the total return to shareholders. In the
Remuneration Committee's opinion this will be achieved by incentivising the Executive Directors to not only ensure that  12 per share is
returned to shareholders but also by providing them with a direct share in the residual value of the Company. As a result, the value of the
awards is directly linked to the value of the residual Company following the return and as such there is a close alignment between the
interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders, both of whom benefit from a maximum value for the residual part of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee will determine whether the performance condition has been satisfied by ensuring the redemption payments
have been made in the allotted time frame.
Shareholding requirement
The Company has a shareholding requirement for both Executive and Non-executive Directors.
The following table sets out the shareholding requirement and the actual shareholdings of the Executive Directors as at 30 April 2007:
Current shareholding as a % of salary Shareholder requirement as a % of salary

Dilution
The only share plan operated by the Company is the 2004(b) LTIP . It is not intended to operate any other Executive or all employee share
incentive arrangements during the year ended 30 April 2008. The Company has historically operated all its share schemes within the ABI
dilution limits excluding the 2004(b) LTIP which was a unique arrangement arising from the change in corporate strategy. There has been
no dilution for the purposes of the ABI dilution limits in the year ended 30 April 2007.
(2) Appointed as a Director on 1 September 2006. Remuneration Committee report continued

Closed share plans
The following table sets out those share plans closed on the reconstruction of the Company in relation to which there are still unpaid
benefits held by the Executive Directors:
Plan Position
The Berkeley Group plc 2000 In accordance with the rules of the Plan the performance conditions were measured on the
Long-Term Incentive Plan reconstruction of the Company and were found to have been satisfied. Therefore, Executives
were entitled to the immediate release of their awards. The Executives, however, agreed to 
defer the release of these awards until their original release dates and for the awards to 
remain subject to the cessation of employment provisions in the rules. No further conditions
apply to the awards as the original performance conditions were satisfied in accordance with 
the rules of the Plan on the reconstruction.
The Berkeley Group plc 2000 The Group Managing Director was the only Executive Director to have unvested options on the
Share Option Plan date of the reconstruction. On the reconstruction his options vested and the Group Managing
Director chose to take the conditional compensation payment
(3)
alternative offered to all holders 
of unvested options under the Plan. The final payments made under this Plan occurred in the 
year ended 30 April 2007.
Pension 
Policy: Lower quartile to median
During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the impact of the Lifetime Allowance under the pension simplification legislation
which came into force from 6 April 2006. The following were the main consequences of this review:
Defined Benefit Plan In the first half of the year all members (active and deferred) of the Defined Benefit Plan were offered a transfer
value from the Plan to their own private pension arrangements and a potential enhanced transfer value from the Defined Benefit Plan or 
a cash payment. The offer was made to all employees and did not vary by grade. Messrs Lewis, Pidgley and Perrins all accepted the offer,
each choosing to receive the enhanced value as a separate taxable cash payment. The transfer values paid from the Plan to the individual
Directors' private pension arrangements and the additional cash payments made to them are set out in the table in the audited section of
the report on page 41.
Ongoing Going forward Executive Directors may receive a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions. Messrs Lewis and Pidgley 
chose this alternative from the start of the year, having ceased to accrue benefits under the Defined Benefit Plan. Mr Perrins chose 
this alternative with effect from 1 October 2006 when he transferred out of the Defined Benefit Plan. Messrs Lewis and Pidgley receive
payments in lieu of pension at 17% of base salary and Mr Perrins at 12%
(4)
of base salary (all these payments are subject to income tax
and national insurance). For the avoidance of doubt these payments are included in the Directors' remuneration table in the audited
section of the report on page 41 but are not included in salary figures for the purposes of determining any other benefit entitlement.
Defined Contribution The other Executive Directors, Messrs Carey and Fry, who did not participate in the Defined Benefit Plan, continue to
receive contributions into their respective defined contribution plans.
It should be noted, however, that the Company is not providing any compensation to Executives for loss of tax relief. Full details of pension
costs for Executive Directors are set out in the audited section of the report on page 42.
Benefits in kind
Policy: Market practice
In line with market practice, the Company's policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional benefits:
 
a fully expensed company car; and
 
medical insurance.
(3) The conditional compensation payment is equal to the difference between the share price of the Company over the ten business days prior to the reconstruction becoming effective and the
exercise price of the relevant option multiplied by the number of shares under such option.
(4) This percentage was increased to 15% p.a. on 1 May 2007 to bring the rate into line with the Divisional Executive Directors on the Board. www.berkeleygroup.co.uk 39
Other Remuneration matters
All employee share schemes
The Board of the Company has consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating Divisions. The historic consensus
view was that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving annual cash bonuses based on the performance of their respective
Divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share scheme. The Board, therefore, did not believe it was in shareholders'
interests to incur the income statement and earnings per share dilutive cost of share arrangements which would not have the desired 
effect on employees. Accordingly the Company has historically introduced appropriate annual bonus arrangements in all of its Divisions.
However, recent consultations have indicated a growing desire for all employees to be offered some form of equity participation. The
Remuneration Committee is currently considering whether to implement such arrangements and if so what structure would be most
appropriate taking into account the Company's current equity structure.
Non-executive Directors' fees
Policy: Upper decile fees
All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by
the articles of association. The 2007 fee levels are based on a specific survey of the fees paid to non-executive Directors in the comparator
group by Halliwell Consulting. The following table sets out the fee rates for the Non-executive Directors in the year ended 30 April 2007
and those rates which will apply in the year ending 30 April 2008:

Chair of Committee fee -  10,000  10,000 - -
The Board has decided to review the fees of the Non-executive Directors annually taking into account the following factors:
 
the workload and level of responsibility of the Non-executive Directors under the changing corporate governance expectations of
shareholders and their representative bodies; and
 
the current market rate for fees for Non-executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Company's share incentive schemes or performance based plans and are not
eligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
Executive Directors' contracts
The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations. The only event on the
occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of employment;
with the maximum payment being 12 months' salary. No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation. In
addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss. Further, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no
unjustified payments for failure. None of the Executive Directors' contracts provides for liquidated damages. There are no special provisions
contained in any of the Executive Directors' contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Director's cessation of employment with
the Company.
(5) A Coppin was appointed on 1 September 2006. Therefore his fees for the year ending 30 April 2007 have been annualised for comparison purposes. Remuneration Committee report continued

Non-executive Directors' agreements
All non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon retirement by
rotation as required by the Company's articles of association. All letters of appointment for Non-executive Directors are renewable annually

(3) During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the impact of the Lifetime Allowance under the pension simplification legislation which came into force from 6 April 2006. As a
consequence Directors may receive a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions. Messrs Lewis and Pidgley chose this alternative from the start of the year, having ceased to accrue benefits
under the Defined Benefit Plan. Mr Perrins chose this alternative with effect from 1 October 2006 when he transferred out of the Defined Benefit Plan. Messrs Lewis and Pidgley received
payments in lieu of pension at 17% of base salary and Mr Perrins at 12% of base salary.
(4) Benefits in kind for all Executive Directors with the exception of the Chairman relate principally to the provision of a fully expensed motor vehicle and private healthcare. The Chairman receives
only private healthcare benefits.
Where Directors were appointed, or resigned, during the year, the figures in the table relate only to the time when the relevant Director was
a Main Board Director.
The release of awards under The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Long Term Incentive Plan and cash compensation payments in respect of 
The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Share Option Plan are set out in the remaining sections of the Remuneration Committee Report.
Pensions
Defined Benefit Plan
In the first half of the year all members (active and deferred) of the Defined Benefit Plan were offered an enhanced transfer value from
the Defined Benefit Plan. The offer was made on equal terms to all employees and did not vary with grade, with the additional amount
available to be taken either as an enhancement to the standard pension transfer value or as a separate taxable cash amount. Messrs
Lewis, Pidgley and Perrins all accepted the offer, each choosing to receive the additional amount as a separate taxable cash amount. The
transfer values paid from the Plan to the individual Directors' private pension arrangements and the additional cash amounts received by
them are set out in the table below.

The transfer values of the Directors' accrued benefits under the Defined Benefit Plan, as set out above, are calculated in accordance with
the Retirement Benefits Scheme - Transfer Values (GN11)  published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. The transfer
values disclosed above as at 1 May 2006 represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would have needed to transfer if the
liability had been transferred to another pension provider at the time in respect of qualifying services. As such they represent a potential
liability of the pension scheme. As the Directors transferred their benefit from the Defined Benefit Plan during the year, the remaining
liability of the pension scheme in respect of them is zero at the end of the year. Members of the fund have the option to pay additional
voluntary contributions; neither these contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the transfer values in the table above.

at 1 May 2006 relates to Units in the Company of 20p (after the redemption of the 2004 B share of 5p). As at 30 April 2007 the beneficial interest in Units relates to Units in the Company of 15p
(after the redemption of the 2004 B share of 5p and the 2006 B share of 5p). This disclosure is unaudited, but included in this table for the convenience of the readers of the accounts.

Under The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Share Option Plan (the 2000 Plan ), Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement, in accordance
with the Plan's rules, resulted in immediate vesting of options under the Plan without reference to satisfaction of the performance
conditions unless the Remuneration Committee deemed otherwise. The Remuneration Committee determined to offer all participants 
with options the opportunity of either exchanging options for options over Units after the reconstruction, or of releasing their options 
in consideration for a conditional cash payment. The basis of calculation of this compensation payment is explained on page 38 and 
will only be provided if the participant is an employee of the Company at the original vesting date for the option. Mr Pidgley chose the
conditional compensation payment in respect of these options. The conditional cash payments are set out in the table below:
