 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT 34
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Background
This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, (the Regulations ). The auditors are 
required to report on the  auditable' part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
The Board has reviewed the Group's compliance with the Combined Code (the Code ) on remuneration related matters. It is the opinion of the 
Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.
Part 2 of the regulations - Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The following table sets out the members of the Remuneration Committee, their date of appointment, their role and the number of meetings the 
Committee had during the year and their respective attendance:

The Remuneration Committee of the Board, except the Chairman of the Company, are all Non-executive Directors and independent. The 
Remuneration Committee members have no personal fi nancial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential confl icts 
of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role described. A copy of the terms of 
reference can be downloaded from the Company's website. 
The Remuneration Committee was advised by Halliwell Consulting until its acquisition by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on 31 December 2008 and 
thereafter by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the remainder of the fi nancial year. 
In determining the Executive Directors' remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the Group Managing Director, 
Mr A W Pidgley and the Group Finance Director, Mr R C Perrins. No Director played a part in any discussion about his or her remuneration.
Remuneration Policy Overview
The objective of the remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives. The Remuneration Committee believes 
that shareholders' interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on performance-related pay. Emphasis on 
performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy. It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that 
the policy provides meaningful incentives to Executives and ensures that the appropriate balance between fi xed and performance related 
compensation is maintained. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews on an annual basis whether its remuneration policy remains appropriate for the relevant fi nancial year. 
Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include:
 market conditions affecting the Company;
 the recruitment market in the Company's sector;
 changing market practice; and
 changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies. 
As announced with Berkeley's 2007/08 results, changes were made at the 2008 Annual General Meeting to Berkeley's remuneration policy. 
This constituted changes to the annual bonus plan performance targets and to the structure of the existing awards under The Berkeley Group 
Holdings plc 2004(b) Long Term Incentive Plan (2004(b) LTIP ), which are discussed later in this report.
In February 2009, Berkeley announced the repositioning of its strategy, enabling the Group to take advantage of current market conditions by 
investing in land and returning to a more traditional dividend policy, rather than committing to return  3 per share by 2014. The annual bonus 
plan performance targets and the 2004(b) LTIP had been linked to the return of the  3 per share; therefore a review of the remuneration policy to 
re-align these targets to the repositioned strategy was required. This 2009 Remuneration Policy was approved at the Company's Extraordinary 
General Meeting on 15 April 2009, and is set out in this report.

Policy for 2008/09 & 2009/10
The 2008/09 fi nancial year started on 1 May 2008 and fi nished on 30 April 2009.
The 2009/10 fi nancial year started on 1 May 2009 and fi nishes on 30 April 2010.
The policy is to set the main elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration package against the following quartiles in the Company's 
comparator group:
Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefi ts in kind Share incentives
Upper decile Upper decile Lower quartile to median Market practice Upper decile
For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Remuneration Committee used the following comparator group of companies in the year 
ended 30 April 2009:
Company name
Amec Plc Bellway Plc Marshalls PLC Taylor Wimpey Plc
Balfour Beatty Plc Bovis Homes Group Plc Persimmon Plc Travis Perkins Plc
Barratt Developments plc Carillion Plc Redrow Plc
It is the intention of the Remuneration Committee to use the same basis for the comparator group for the year ending 30 April 2010.
2008/09 Balance between Fixed and Variable Performance based Pay
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fi xed and variable performance based pay for each Executive Director for the year ended 30 
April 2009:
The Executive Directors hold no external appointments. 
The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described below. 
Elements of Executive Directors' Remuneration
Basic Salary
Policy: Upper decile 
Policy
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that the salaries of the Executive Directors should be set at the upper decile in line with the 
Committee's view that the Company has one of the most experienced and capable Executive teams within the sector. When determining the salaries 
of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration:
  the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and 
complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group;
 the performance of the individual Executive Director; 
 the individual Executive Director's experience and responsibilities; and
 the pay and conditions throughout the Company.

GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT 36
Year ended 30 April 2009 and year ending 30 April 2010
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in May 2008 for 2008/09, as it had done in May 2007 for 2007/08. On 
both occasions the Committee felt that:
 taking into account the above criteria; 
 the exceptional absolute and comparative performance of the Company during this challenging period; and
  the fact that with the exception of the Finance Director, the Executive Directors have not had a rise in salaries since May 2003;
salary rises were appropriate.
In May 2007, increases of between 5% and 7.5% were awarded by the Remuneration Committee in respect of the year ended 30 April 2008. 
However, at the time the Executive Directors believed that the current balance of the remuneration package was appropriate and the salary 
recommendations were therefore not implemented in the year.
In May 2008, further increases of between 6.25% and 9.75% were awarded by the Remuneration Committee in respect of the year ended 30 April 
2009. However, in this case the Executive Directors decided, given the prevailing market conditions, not to take increases and therefore the salary 
recommendations were not implemented in the year.
In respect of 2009/10, the Committee remains of the view that the previously recommended salaries are appropriate. However, they have not been 
implemented for the reasons set out above and therefore the salaries will remain at their historic level. It should be noted that by keeping salaries at 
these historic levels the Executive Directors have not taken cumulative increases of between 11.5% and 18% in respect of 2007/08 and 2008/09.

Annual performance-related bonus
Policy: Upper decile bonus potential
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to set the maximum annual bonus potential at the upper decile in relation to the comparator group. 
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
General
The maximum annual bonus potential is 200% of salary. 
Bonus targets are reviewed each year and agreed by the Remuneration Committee. The performance measures for the Executive Directors' 
bonus plan are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the 
Company, so that they continue to remain challenging. 
Bonuses up to 100% of salary will be paid in cash. The Executive must hold shares equivalent to the net value of any bonus paid above 100% of 
salary for eighteen months.
Year ended 30 April 2009
The targets for the year ended 30 April 2009, their level of achievement and the corresponding bonus earned by the Executive Directors are set out 
in the following tables:
Bonus Potentials & Targets for 2008/09 & 2009/10
The following table shows the maximum bonus potential for each of the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 April 2009 and year ending 
30 April 2010. In addition, the table shows the percentage of that maximum bonus potential subject to each performance target for the year ended

Bonus Performance Criteria
Group performance condition 
The Group annual bonus targets, as approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGM, require the Company to have made payments equivalent to  3 per 
share by 2010/11, either through:
  Additional Land Expenditure;
  dividends;
  share buy-backs by the Company (or the Company Employee Benefi t Trust on behalf of the Company to satisfy the 2004(b) LTIP awards); or 
  a combination of the above.
Following the announcement in February 2009 that Berkeley was repositioning its strategy, this target was refi ned in order to avoid a potential 
confl ict of interest arising from the requirement to actually make the payments by the end of this period as the exact timing of suitable opportunities 
cannot be predetermined, so that now the targets will also be satisfi ed where the Company has generated an equivalent amount of cash. This was 
approved by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 April 2009.
For the purposes of this target, Additional Land Expenditure is defi ned as expenditure on land over and above the cost of land that has been 
expensed through the income statement which is set at 13.1%, being the land cost percentage in the land bank at 30 April 2008.
For 2010/11, this is an absolute target. For 2008/09 and 2009/10, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfi ed that the Group is on target to meet 
this test for the bonus to be earned.
Divisional PBT performance condition
The divisional PBT targets are set at the beginning of the fi nancial year at a level which is challenging taking into account the potential level of bonus 
payments, the market, development availability and other relevant issues. The Remuneration Committee confi rms that the annual bonus payments 
set out within this report for the Divisional Executive Directors are appropriate taking into account the level of profi t achieved and the targets set at 
the beginning of the year ended 30 April 2009. 
Share Incentives
Policy: Upper decile
Executive Directors
On 28 August 2008 at the Annual General Meeting of the Company, shareholders approved an amendment to The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 
2004(b) Long-Term Incentive Plan which split the original awards granted into two elements (Element 1 and Element 2).
On 15 April 2009, at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company, shareholders approved the introduction of a new incentive plan, The 
Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2009 LTIP . The 2009 LTIP incorporated and replaces Element 2 of the 2004(b) LTIP and the previously approved 2007 
LTIP , as set out below:
2004(b) LTIP Element 1
9/12 of the number of shares subject to the original awards under the 2004(b) LTIP , totalling 15,991,021, were conditionally released on 28 August 
2008 following shareholder approval at the Company's Annual General Meeting.
The condition of release was that the Executive Director does not resign prior to the relevant unconditional release date set out in the table below. If 
he does so, any element of the conditionally released award which has not been unconditionally released at this date shall lapse:
       
Percentage of Element 1 of the Award Unconditionally Released Unconditional Release Dates 
25% 28 October 2008
25% 16 April 2009
25% On or around 1 September 2009
25% On or around 1 March 2010
 
Of the shares conditionally released (subject to shares sold or netted-off to satisfy any tax liability), the Executive Director will only be able to sell 
each fi nancial year a maximum of 10% of the net award until 31 January 2014 at which point the sale restrictions shall lapse.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT [CONTINUED]
2004(b) LTIP Element 2/2009 LTIP Part A
The balance of the shares originally awarded under the 2004(b) LTIP (i.e. 3/12 of the shares), totalling 5,330,340 shares, are to be replaced by 
options with an exercise price of  3 per share granted under the 2009 LTIP .
This new option is identifi ed as Part A of the 2009 LTIP . These options were awarded after the year end, on 29 June 2009, at which time the Element 
2 awards under the 2004 (b) LTIP were surrendered. 
Options will become exercisable on 31 January 2014 subject to the relevant Executive's continued employment with the Company.
2009 LTIP Part B
Part B of the 2009 LTIP is equivalent to the number of shares which shareholders agreed could be issued under the 2007 LTIP . Following 
shareholder approval on 15 April 2009 this number of shares is now capable of being granted as Part B of the 2009 LTIP and the 2007 LTIP 
has been cancelled. 
Shares under Part B of the 2009 LTIP will be granted as market priced options which will vest subject to:-
  continued employment to the relevant vesting date; and
  the satisfaction of the underpin condition that Net Assets Per Share are at least  5.94 at 15 April 2015.
Vesting of these options will be in two tranches:-
    on 15 April 2015; and
    on 15 April 2016.
The total number of shares subject to Part B of the 2009 LTIP is 7,100,000 shares. The initial awards were made shortly after the results for 2008/09 
were announced on 29 June 2009.

Other Senior Employees of the Company
The Company's business comprises of a number of operating Divisions. The Remuneration Committee in conjunction with the Board has, therefore, 
implemented both annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for these other senior employees of the Company linked to the 
performance of the relevant Division for which they work. Some elements of the cash bonus plans are annual while other elements are deferred to 
ensure long-term consistent delivery by each Division. The Remuneration Committee, in line with best practice, continually reviews with the Board 
the policy behind the compensation plans at this level in the Company to ensure they remain appropriate to the market and the Company's current 
circumstances. It is the view of both the Committee and the Board as a whole that these arrangements are very effective at ensuring the delivery 
of Divisional performance for which these senior employees are responsible. Both the Remuneration Committee and the Board believe that having 
senior employees focused on the delivery of Divisional results is an excellent way of driving shareholder value. 
In addition, a number of senior employees of the Company are eligible to participate in Part B of the 2009 LTIP .
Shareholding Requirement
The Company has a shareholding requirement for both Executive and Non-executive Directors. The following table sets out the shareholding 
requirement and the actual shareholdings of the Executive Directors as at 30 April 2009:

Dilution
Both the 2004(b) LTIP and 2009 LTIP were special arrangements approved by shareholders; historically the Company has operated all its share 
schemes within the ABI dilution limits. It is not intended to operate any other Executive or all employee share incentive arrangements during 
2009/10. There has been no dilution other than under these special arrangements for the purposes of the ABI dilution limits in the year ended 
30 April 2009.
Pension 
Policy: Lower quartile to median
Messrs Pidgley and Perrins receive payments in lieu of pension at 17% and 15% of base salary respectively (all these payments are subject to income 
tax and national insurance). These payments are not included in salary fi gures for the purposes of determining any other benefi t entitlement.
The other Executive Directors, Messrs Carey and Fry continue to receive contributions into their respective defi ned contribution plans.
Full details of pension costs for Executive Directors are set out, in the audited section of the report on page 41.
Benefi ts in Kind
Policy: Market practice
In line with market practice, the Company's policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional benefi ts:
  a fully expensed company car; and
  medical insurance.
Other Remuneration Matters
All Employee Share Plans
The Company has regularly consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating Divisions on whether it was appropriate to 
introduce all employee share plans. The consensus view remains that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving annual cash bonuses 
based on the performance of their respective Divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share plan. The Board, therefore, does 
not believe it is in shareholders' interests to incur the income statement and dilutive cost of share arrangements which would not have the desired 
effect on employees. Accordingly the Company will continue to operate appropriate annual bonus arrangements in all of its Divisions. 
Non-executive Directors' Fees
Policy: Upper decile fees
All Non-executive Directors have specifi c terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the 
Articles of Association. The 2008/09 fee levels are based on a specifi c survey of the fees paid to Non-executive Directors in the comparator group 
by Halliwell Consulting. The following table sets out the fee rates for the Non-executive Directors in the year ended 30 April 2009 and those rates 
which will apply in the year ending 30 April 2010:

The Board has decided to review the fees of the Non-executive Directors annually taking into account the following factors:
  the workload and level of responsibility of the Non-executive Directors under the changing corporate governance expectations of shareholders 
and their representative bodies; and
  the current market rate for fees for Non-executive Directors.

GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT 40
Following the review in 2008/09 the Board has determined that no fee increases will be made for 2009/10.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Company's share incentive schemes or performance based plans and are not eligible to 
join the Company's pension scheme. 
Executive Directors' Contracts
The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations. The only event on the occurrence of 
which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of employment; with the maximum 
payment being 12 months salary. No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation. In addition, Executive Directors will 
be expected to mitigate their loss. Further, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustifi ed payments for failure. None 
of the Executive Directors' contracts provides for liquidated damages. There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors' 
contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company. Further, there are no special provisions providing for 
additional compensation on an Executive Director's cessation of employment with the Company.
Non-executive Directors' Agreements
All Non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon retirement by rotation as 
required by the Company's Articles of Association. All letters of appointment for Non-executive Directors are renewable annually on 1 May.
