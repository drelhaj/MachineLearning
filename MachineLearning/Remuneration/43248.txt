Remuneration report 
Our  businesses Directors'  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
The Directors present the Remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2009. The report describes how the Company has 
applied the principles of the Combined Code with regard to 
remuneration. Sections 3(iv) to 3(viii) and  Remuneration earned in 
the financial year' on pages 59 to 61 are subject to audit.
1 The  Remuneration  Committee
The Board has delegated authority to the Remuneration 
Committee ( the Committee') to determine the remuneration and 
other terms and conditions of the Executive Directors, the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary and to formulate the policy 
for their remuneration. The Committee is also responsible for 
reviewing the remuneration trends across the Company and its 
major businesses and for reviewing the remuneration of those 
individuals identified as key and senior management by the Board 
of the Company.
The Committee had access to the advice of the Chief Executive, the 
Company Secretary and the Charter HR Director (none of whom 
participated in any discussion directly relating to their own 
remuneration). In conducting its duties the Committee was also 
advised by Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants ( HNBS' part of 
Hewitt Associates), who provided independent advice regarding the 
Executive Directors' remuneration on a range of issues throughout 
the year, including the changes for 2010 set out below and Watson 
Wyatt who were engaged to present an overview of remuneration 
trends and to facilitate a Committee discussion on remuneration 
policy. Neither HNBS nor Watson Wyatt provided any other services 
to the Company during the year; however, Hewitt Associates 
provided actuarial advice to the Company.
The members of the Committee are Grey Denham, John Biles, 
Andrew Osborne and Manfred Wennemer (all of whom are 
independent Non-Executive Directors) and Lars Emilson (the 
Chairman of the Company). The Hon. James Bruce retired from 
the Board and as the Committee' s Chairman on 29 April 2009 and 
Grey Denham was appointed Chairman of the Committee on that 
date. Manfred Wennemer joined the Committee on his 
appointment to the Board on 26 March 2009. Details of the 
number of meetings held by the Committee in 2009, as well as 
attendance details, can be found in the table contained in the 
Corporate governance report on page 49.
During 2009 some of the key issues addressed by the Committee 
were as follows:
   reviewing and updating the Company' s policy on Executive 
Directors' remuneration to ensure it remained appropriate;
   reviewing the base salaries of the Executive Directors for 2010;
   setting performance targets in line with the Company' s strategy 
for the annual bonus plan for 2010 and determining the amounts 
potentially payable, including increasing the maximum for the 
Chief Executive;
   reviewing the structure of the long-term incentive arrangements 
and proposing changes to them for 2010;
   agreeing to the percentage of the long-term incentive awards 
that should vest; and
   agreeing to the amounts payable in respect of the annual bonus 
scheme.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available upon 
request from the Company Secretary and are on the Company' s 
website at www.charter.ie.
2 Remuneration  policy
The Company seeks to attract, motivate and retain exceptional 
executives who have experience of operating in geographically 
complex, international engineering and manufacturing companies; 
in order to achieve these aims the Committee keeps the 
remuneration packages of Executive Directors under regular 
review.
The policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors is designed 
to ensure that their total reward is competitive and linked both to 
individual and business performance. Risk is taken into account 
when setting the targets and when determining entitlements under 
variable reward schemes; this is done by ensuring that targets, 
whilst stretching, are realistic, attainable and for the long-term 
benefit of the Company and that they are achievable without taking 
inappropriate business risks.
The salaries paid to Executive Directors are dependent on the 
experience and capabilities of the individual and are determined 
after having regard to the salaries paid by similar complex or 
geographically diverse businesses.
Short-term incentives (i.e. annual bonuses) are seen as an essential 
part of total reward and incentivisation for Executive Directors. 
Annual bonus targets will include separate elements for 
performance against both financial criteria (ordinarily calculated at 
constant currency rates) and personal objectives. The targets set 
will aim to address the issues facing the business over the coming 
year. It is the Committee' s view that the bonus plan design should 
remain flexible and, where appropriate, be adjusted to reflect 
economic conditions.
The Committee believes that bonuses should reward high 
performance and deliver higher reward on the achievement of 
significant performance above expectation. It retains a discretion to 
adjust the amount of bonus paid if it believes the amount payable 
to be inappropriate in the light of underlying financial performance 
or economic circumstances.
25 per cent of bonus payments will ordinarily be deferred for three 
years and delivered by way of shares with no vesting for Directors 
who leave voluntarily or for cause during that period.
It is the view of the Committee that there should be long-term 
incentive plans for Executive Directors whereby they are rewarded 
with interests in the Company' s shares for sustained performance 
over a period of time. As such, long-term incentives will continue to 
form an important element of total executive remuneration and 
appropriate performance criteria such as total shareholder return 
( TSR') and/or earnings per share ( EPS') will be used. All structural 
changes to long-term incentive arrangements requiring shareholder 
approval will be consulted upon with leading shareholders and 
shareholder bodies prior to such consent being sought.
The Committee considers that a substantial portion of 
remuneration should be linked to performance. Following the 
changes proposed for 2010, around 50 per cent of the Chief 
Executive' s target remuneration package will be fixed pay, with 
the balance split broadly equally between annual bonus and 
long-term incentives.
When setting remuneration levels for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee has regard to general pay and employment policies 
across the Company as a whole as well as the wider market, in 
order to ensure that a coherent policy applies. 56      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

3  Overview  of  remuneration
(a) 2009 Review
A detailed review of the remuneration packages of the Executive 
Directors was undertaken in 2009. The results highlighted that the 
total remuneration packages and certain elements of them were 
uncompetitive. Details of the changes to base salaries, a change to 
the bonus plan for the Chief Executive and proposed changes to 
the Long-T erm Incentive Plan resulting from this review are set out 
in the relevant sections below. When considering these changes 
the Committee took into account the need to bring the Executive 
Directors' remuneration packages more closely into line with the 
market whilst recognising the need for pay constraint in the current 
economic climate.
(b) Executive Directors
(i) Base salary
The base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually 
and following exceptional one-off events where the individual 
responsibilities of the Executive Director change significantly. 
Salaries are benchmarked against those paid to directors in 
companies in comparable sectors which are of a similar size and 
international complexity.
The base salaries of the Executive Directors were reviewed with 
effect from 1 January 2010 and details of the increases awarded 
are set out on page 59.
(ii) Bonus
The maximum bonus potential of the Executive Directors in 2009 
was 100 per cent of salary.
Actual bonus payouts in respect of 2009 were dependent on the 
achievement of a number of corporate and individual targets as 
discussed below. In order to align the interests of Directors with 
those of the Company' s shareholders, it is the Company' s policy 
that bonuses are only payable for the achievement of stretching 
performance targets, the majority of which are linked to the 
Company' s financial performance. For the year ended 
31 December 2009, these targets were as follows:
(1) 64 per cent of bonus: EPS performance relative to budget;
(2) 16 per cent of bonus: cash flow performance relative to 
budget; and
(3) 20 per cent of bonus: personal performance.
For target 1, 40 per cent of the maximum bonus was payable for 
meeting budget (rather than 50 per cent as had been the practice 
in previous years) and for target 2, 50 per cent of the maximum 
bonus was payable for meeting budget. The maximum bonus 
would only become payable for a performance that was 
substantially in excess of budget. The Committee has reserved the 
overriding discretion to review aggregate bonus levels payable to 
Executive Directors based on the above criteria to ensure that they 
are appropriate taking into account the underlying financial 
performance of the Company and other factors. The bonuses 
payable to Executive Directors are not pensionable.
Following a review of the Executive Directors' performance and the 
financial performance of the Company during the year ended 
31 December 2009, the Committee determined that the threshold 
EPS target had not been achieved and accordingly no bonus was 
paid in respect of this element. The threshold cash flow target was 
achieved and accordingly, a bonus payment of 5.8 per cent of 
salary was made in respect of this element of the bonus. 
In recognition of individual performances in respect of objectives 
set to strengthen and rationalise the Company, bonus payments 
were made at 20 per cent of salary in respect of the personal 
performance element. Details of the bonuses paid to the Executive 
Directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 2009 are set 
out on page 59.
In respect of the year ending 31 December 2010, with one 
exception, bonuses payable to the Executive Directors will be 
measured against the same performance categories and on the 
same basis as those used in determining the 2009 bonus 
entitlements. The Committee believes that EPS and cash remain 
the Company' s most important metrics for 2010, with the recovery 
in earnings the most important priority for the year. The only change 
is in respect of the EPS target whereby 50 per cent of the 
maximum bonus for that performance category will be payable for 
meeting budget. This will require a significant improvement over 
2009. The maximum bonus will only become payable for a 
performance that is substantially in excess of budget and the 
threshold above which a percentage of the bonus first becomes 
payable (zero is payable at threshold) has been set at an EPS level 
above that achieved by the Company in 2009.
For the year ending 31 December 2010, Michael Foster' s 
maximum bonus potential will increase from 100 per cent of salary 
to 125 per cent of salary. The Committee considers that this 
increase is appropriate and brings his maximum potential bonus 
entitlement more closely into line with the market.
The Committee has agreed that performance under the EPS 
element of the bonus will be measured on a constant currency 
basis. The Committee believes that this approach is a better 
reflection of management' s underlying performance since 
exchange rates are not within management' s control.
(iii) Deferred Bonus Plan ( DBP')
One-quarter of any bonus paid to Executive Directors will be paid 
in shares acquired in the market and compulsorily deferred for 
three years under the DBP . If Executive Directors leave voluntarily or 
for cause during this deferral period, their awards will normally 
lapse. These shares are held in trust prior to their release on vesting 
following the expiration of the three-year deferral period.
(iv) Long-term incentives
Michael Foster's Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  MF Plan')
As described in previous remuneration reports, Michael Foster was 
granted an option over the Company' s ordinary shares pursuant to 
a one-off arrangement that was put in place specifically to facilitate 
and secure his appointment as Commercial Director in 2005. 
The option was granted pursuant to paragraph 9.4.2 of the 
Stock Exchange Listing Rules, and so did not require shareholder 
approval. No grants were made in respect of the year under review 
and there is no intention to make any grants under this plan in the 
future.
The options had an exercise price of 217.99 pence, and were 
subject to performance conditions based on the Company' s EPS 
and total shareholder return performance over the three years from 
grant. 50 per cent of the option required average real earnings per 
share growth of 3 per cent per annum over a single three-year 
period whilst the remaining 50 per cent was dependent upon the 
Company' s TSR performance ranking in the upper quartile of the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts). Both conditions 
were met in full, and so the option became exercisable on 
13 March 2008. In  accordance with the rules of the plan Mr Foster 
exercised his award on 9 March 2009.
Charter International plc Long-Term Incentive Plan ( CI LTIP')
The CI LTIP was approved by the shareholders of the Company on 
27 August 2008. Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    57
Our  businesses Directors'  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
Under the CI LTIP , Executive Directors and selected other 
members of key management are eligible to receive awards which 
vest at nil cost to the executive three years after grant, subject to 
the satisfaction of performance conditions.
Currently, an individual may not receive awards in any financial year 
over shares having a market value in excess of 100 per cent of 
salary, except in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or 
retention, where an individual may receive an award over shares 
worth up to 200 per cent of their annual salary.
It is proposed that the rules of the CI LTIP be amended to increase 
the maximum market value of shares over which awards may be 
made in any financial year from 100 per cent to 150 per cent of 
annual salary. A resolution to approve this amendment to the rules 
of the CI LTIP will be put to the shareholders of the Company at the 
AGM to be held on 29 April 2010; details of the resolution are set 
out in the shareholders' circular and notice of meeting dated 
23 March 2010. The Committee considers that this will provide 
them with the necessary flexibility to award grants of LTIPs that 
are in line with market practice.
In 2010, awards are proposed to be made to the Executive 
Directors of 125 per cent of annual salary. If in future, the 
Committee contemplates making awards at above 125 per cent of 
salary, it is the intention to consult with major investors beforehand.
Vesting is currently based on the Company' s TSR performance 
compared with the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding 
investment trusts) over a single three-year period beginning on the 
date of the grant of the award. No vesting occurs for a below-
median ranking. At median, 25 per cent of the shares vest and at 
upper quartile 100 per cent of the shares vest. Between median 
and upper quartile rankings, awards vest on a straight-line basis. 
In addition, awards only vest if the Committee is satisfied that there 
has been a significant improvement in the Company' s underlying 
financial performance over the three-year performance period. 
Awards normally only vest on or after the third anniversary of the 
date of grant provided that the individual remains an employee of 
the Company and the performance conditions and any other 
objective conditions have been satisfied. HNBS performs the 
TSR calculations for the purposes of the LTIP .
The Committee proposes that future awards made under the 
CI LTIP be subject to a new performance condition pursuant to 
which 60 per cent of the award will be based on the Company' s 
relative TSR performance over three financial years and 40 per cent 
on adjusted EPS growth over the same three years. In future years, 
the Committee will consider the mix between EPS and TSR in 
the light of the then circumstances, but will only alter the balance 
after consultation with the Company' s major shareholders. 
The Committee recognises that relative TSR aligns management 
reward with returns to investors, but considers that the introduction 
of an EPS-related element will provide a good balance and a clear 
connection between management performance and rewards. 
However, irrespective of the TSR outcome, no awards will vest in 
relation to the TSR part of the award unless the Committee is 
satisfied with the underlying financial performance of the Company 
over the performance period. EPS will be defined for this purpose 
on an adjusted basis and will be measured consistently. The 
Committee has considered carefully the range of targets for the 
2010 award and proposes that the range should be RPI plus an 
average of 6 per cent p.a. to RPI plus an average of 12 per cent 
p.a., with 25 per cent vesting at RPI plus 6 per cent p.a., rising on a 
straight-line basis until full vesting is achieved at RPI plus 12 per 
cent p.a. The Committee considers that this is a demanding range. 
The Committee wishes to retain the flexibility to set new targets 
each year, depending on the circumstances, but any new range 
will be no less challenging in the circumstances than the original 
range was when it was set. A resolution to approve this new 
performance condition will be put to the shareholders of the 
Company at the AGM to be held on 29 April 2010; details of the 
resolution are set out in the shareholders' circular and Notice of 
meeting dated 23 March 2010.
(v) Share ownership guidelines
The Executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain a 
holding of 100 per cent worth of salary in shares in the Company. 
This is expected to be built via the retention of at least 50 per cent 
of the net gain on vested awards under the Company' s share 
incentive schemes until the guideline has been achieved.
(vi) Dilution
In the period to 31 December 2009 the Company has remained 
within the headroom limits set out in the ABI Guidelines  Executive 
Remuneration - Policies and Practices', for the Company' s existing 
share plans as set out below:
Total issued share capital at 31 December 2009 166,955,167
All schemes (10% in any rolling 10 -year period) 1,876,431
Remaining headroom 14,819,085
Discretionary schemes (5% in any rolling 10-year period) 1,876,431
Remaining headroom 6,471,327
The Committee has the flexibility to satisfy awards pursuant to the 
CI LTIP by either a market purchase or new issue of the Company' s 
shares. T o date the Company has not bought shares to hedge the 
exposure to the Company' s share price; however, the Committee 
keeps its hedging policy under review. Awards under the DBP will 
be satisfied by shares purchased in the market.
(vii) Pensions
All of the Executive Directors are members of the Charter HM 
Revenue & Customs-approved pension scheme. Mr Foster' s 
accrual rate is one-thirtieth of base salary, and Messrs Careless 
and Deeley' s accrual rates are one-forty-fifth of base salary, for 
each year of service as an Executive Director. They are all subject 
to a cap on pensionable earnings of  105,600 per annum and are 
entitled to receive, in lieu of pension over the cap, an allowance to 
the value of 25 per cent of the excess of base salary over the cap. 
These payments are included in their emoluments shown on 
page 59. Mr Deeley has elected that, from this amount, 9 per cent 
of his base salary in excess of the cap is paid to the Company' s 
defined contribution stakeholder pension scheme. Details of 
pension entitlements can be found in the table on page 60.
(viii) Other benefits
Further benefits contained within the remuneration packages of the 
Executive Directors comprise tax-assessable benefits arising from 
employment and include car and petrol allowances, medical 
insurance for the Executive Directors and their immediate 
dependants and life assurance.
(ix) Service contracts
Details of the service contracts of those individuals who served as 
Executive Directors during the year are set out below. The normal 
retirement age of all the Executive Directors is 65.
The Executive Directors entered into new service agreements with 
Charter Central Services Limited ( CCSL') on 27 August 2008 
which became effective on 22 October 2008 (the  Service 
Agreements' and each a  Service Agreement'). The Service 
Agreements are terminable in writing by CCSL upon 12 months' 
prior written notice; by Messrs Careless and Deeley on six months' 
prior written notice, and by Mr Foster on nine months' prior written 
notice. If the Service Agreement of either Michael Foster or  58      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Remuneration report 
continued
Robert Careless is terminated by CCSL except with notice, on retirement or for cause, then CCSL shall pay as liquidated damages an 
amount equal to the value of each Executive Director' s annual salary, including both pension allowance and the value of the Executive 
Director' s lost pension benefits. In respect of the service contract of Mr Deeley, and for Directors appointed in the future, the Committee 
will look to apply the principles of mitigation following termination.
CCSL has agreed  tax equalisation' arrangements with each Executive Director under which, if the amount of any remuneration paid by 
CCSL or any Associated Company to that Director is taxed in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, CCSL or the Director will 
make a balancing payment so that the amount received by the Director after tax in respect of that remuneration is the same as it would 
have been had he only been subject to United Kingdom tax in respect of it. Similar  tax equalisation' arrangements have been put in place 
for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, with the exception of Manfred Wennemer, who is a German resident and was not 
previously on the board of the former Charter plc.
The Executive Directors entered into letters of appointment in respect of their duties as Directors of the Company which took effect on 
22 October 2008. Each appointment will be subject to termination by either party giving the other party not less than one month' s notice 
in writing and will automatically cease if that Executive Director ceases to be an employee of CCSL.
(x) Total shareholder return ( TSR')
TSR calculations are carried out independently by HNBS by monitoring the percentage change in the Company' s share price plus 
dividends reinvested over a period of time. The chart below shows the value by 31 December 2009, of  100 invested in Charter plc on 
31 December 2004 and re-invested in Charter International plc on 22 October 2008 as compared with  100 invested in the FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts) index on the same date. The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.

FTSE 250 (ex Investment Trusts)
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) is the most appropriate index against which the TSR of 
Charter should be measured because it is an index of similar-sized companies.
(c) Non-Executive Directors
The Board has delegated authority to the Standing Committee to determine the fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors and has 
delegated authority to the Remuneration Committee to determine the fees payable to the Chairman. Non-Executive Directors are not 
eligible to participate in any of the Company' s bonus, pension or share incentive schemes. They do not have service contracts but their 
terms of engagement are regulated by letters of appointment that comply with the recommendations of the Combined Code, details of 
which are set out below:

The fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors during 2009 were  57,750 per annum, with the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees being paid an additional  6,000 and  4,000 per annum respectively. The additional fees payable to the chairmen of the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees reflect the increased duties attributable to fulfilling those roles. The policy is to review the fees payable to 
the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors on an annual basis. With effect from January 2010, it was agreed to increase the 
Non-Executive Directors' fees by  2,500. The total fees payable to the Chairman of the Company remained unchanged.
Non-Executive appointment letters are available for inspection at the Company' s registered office and will be made available at the AGM.
(d) External appointments
No Executive Directors currently hold any external directorships of listed companies.

(1) During the period, the remuneration of the Executive Directors was split so that, in common with the Non-Executive Directors, they 
received fees from Charter International plc of  57,750 in respect of their duties as Directors of Charter International plc. At the same 
time the salaries received by them from CCSL in respect of their executive duties on behalf of the rest of the Charter Group were 
reduced by an equivalent amount so that in aggregate they received the same remuneration.
(2) With effect from 1 January 2010, the fees payable to all Directors in respect of their duties as Directors of Charter International were increased 
from  57,750 to  60,250 per annum, with the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees continuing to be paid an additional 
 6,000 and  4,000 respectively . The additional fees payable to the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees reflect the 
increased duties attributable to fulfilling these roles. The total fees payable to the Chairman of the Company remained unchanged.
(3) With effect from the annual review on 1 January 2010, the current base salary and fees of the Executive Directors are as follows:

 The percentage increase in Michael Foster' s salary was 2.5 per cent, which was below the forecast average increase for employees 
across the whole Group. Robert Careless received a 4.8 per cent increase to bring him more closely into alignment with the market. 
James Deeley received a 7 per cent increase to reflect the greater responsibility he had taken on during 2009. 60      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009

3 The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
4 The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another pension 
provider on transferring the scheme's liabilities in respect of the Director's pension benefits. It does not represent sums payable to the individual 
Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
5 The transfer value of the increases in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits 
that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the change in its transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase 
or decrease in its transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting the transfer 
value at the beginning of the period, as well as additional value earned in the year.

1 The value of the awards under the LTIP shows the number of the awards held multiplied by the market price of the Company's shares at 31 December 
2009. The assumption is that the maximum number of options/awards vested in accordance with the performance conditions described on page 57 . 
 It should be noted that the actual value may be less than the maximum, including zero if performance conditions are not met.
2 The number of shares granted on 09 March 2009 is the share equivalent of 100 per cent of the base salary based on the average of the 
mid-market closing values of the Company's shares for the five dealing days ending on 6 March 2009, being 409.5 pence.
3 These awards under the DBP represent 25 per cent of the bonus payable to the Executive Directors, in respect of the year ended 31 December 
2008. The awards were calculated by reference to the average share price of the Company over the five dealing days ending on 6 March 2009, 
being 409.5 pence.
4 Awards represent the reinvestment of the final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2009 using a share price of 899 pence to calculate the 
number of shares subject to the award, which was the share price on the ex-dividend date of 30 April 2009.
5 On 9 March 2009 Michael Foster exercised his award under the MF Plan in full following satisfaction of the performance conditions. 109,319 shares 
were sold to meet the exercise price, tax and NI liabilities, the remaining 39,770 shares were retained by Michael Foster. The market price on the 
date of exercise was 387 .5 pence.
6 On 29 April 2009 Michael Foster and Robert Careless exercised their awards under the LTIP granted on the 24 March 2006. The assessment of the 
performance conditions produced a vesting of 42 per cent of the original award. Michael Foster sold 6,775 shares to meet the tax and NI liabilities 
and retained 12,703 shares. Robert Careless sold 4,961 shares to meet the tax and NI liabilities and retained 7 ,929 shares. The market price on the 
date of exercise was 525 pence.
7 The performance conditions for the LTIP were not met and the award lapsed.
8 During the year, the range of share prices was 315.5 pence to 770.0 pence, with the price on 31 December 2009 being 722.0 pence.
9 The performance conditions applying to any of the above awards are as described on page 57 .
10 The accrued cost of Directors' LTIP awards outstanding at 31 December 2009, calculated in accordance with IFRS2  share-based payment' was 
 1.9 million (2008:  1.3 million).
