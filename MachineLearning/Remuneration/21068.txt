Peter Hickson and Jonson Cox attend the meetings at 
the invitation of the Committee, but do not participate 
in discussions concerning their own remuneration. The
Committee is supported by the Group Director of Human
Resources, Susannah Clements, and the Joint Company
Secretaries, Patrick Firth and Claire Russell. 
Kepler Associates were retained throughout the year to
provide advice on Executive Director remuneration, but do
not provide any other service to the group. A complete
review of Directors' remuneration is carried out annually,
taking into account comparable practice in similar
companies and the financial and operational performance
of the group.
Remuneration policy
The primary aim of the company's remuneration policy 
is to ensure that AWG is well managed by high calibre
executives who are encouraged to produce superior
performance and leadership on a sustainable basis for 
the benefit of shareholders, customers and employees.
The remuneration package is designed to attract, retain,
motivate and reward the executive and senior
management of AWG whilst reflecting their
responsibilities and experience. In addition, the current
policy aims to align the interests of executives with those
of all the company's stakeholders by ensuring that the
award of annual bonuses reflects a balance between
financial and non-financial measures. Long-term
incentives are in place to reward the achievement 
of long-term performance targets.
The remuneration policy is designed to ensure that there
is a significant emphasis on the performance-linked
element of total compensation. To this end, base salaries
are targeted at mid-market when compared with similar
companies in the utilities and support services sectors.
Executives and senior managers are able to achieve
additional earnings via the annual bonus scheme and 
the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) only if demanding
performance targets are achieved. 
Objective benchmarking of other relevant peer group
companies is carried out by Kepler Associates to guide 
the Committee in its annual review of remuneration. 
The main focus of comparison is towards:
  Water companies.
  Support service companies.
  Comparable companies with a similar 
enterprise value.
Over the coming year there will, as usual, be individual
reviews of base salary, annual bonus and LTIP awards.
Remuneration package
Each Executive Director's package comprises four
elements: base salary and benefits, annual bonus,
participation in the LTIP and pension. The benefits
comprise a car or cash equivalent; insurance policies
covering disability, personal accident, life and health; 
30 days' holiday and, in common with all eligible
employees, participation in a Sharesave Scheme and
Sharebuy Plan. As Chairman, Peter Hickson receives 
the fees and benefits detailed on page 55. He does not
participate in the annual bonus, the LTIP, the Sharesave
Scheme or the Sharebuy Plan.  Governance 52

Base salary and benefits
Base salary and benefits are reviewed annually, taking into
account competitive practice. The Committee targets a
mid-market position once an individual is fully established
in the role.
Incentive arrangements
Annual bonus scheme
The Executive Directors and other senior managers
participate in an annual bonus scheme, which rewards
them for achieving demanding short-term performance
targets and personal objectives. The annual bonus scheme
comprises two elements, one year business plan targets
(earning two-thirds of the bonus) and personal and
strategic objectives (earning one-third of the bonus). 
50 per cent of the business plan element pays out if the
annual budget is achieved and a further payment of up 
to 50 per cent is made for exceeding the plan to levels
approved by the Committee. 
During 2005, the Committee reviewed the group's annual
bonus opportunities and decided to combine a moderate
increase with a retention requirement so as to reflect the
strategic challenge faced by AWG during the turnaround
process, and to strengthen the link between pay and
performance. For Executive Directors, the maximum 
bonus payable is 75 per cent of base salary and for senior
managers the maximum bonus ranges between 45 per
cent and 75 per cent.
The Committee recognises that it is in the interests 
of all shareholders that Executive Directors and senior
management build up a personal stake in the group and
as a result has developed share ownership guidelines as
outlined on page 53. Accordingly, the Committee agreed
that participants in the 2005/6 Annual Retained Bonus
Scheme (ARBS) should invest at least one-third of their
post-tax annual bonus in AWG shares for a period 
of three years. If performance targets are achieved over
this period, participants receive matching free shares 
in AWG Plc equal in value to the gross amount of the
bonus used to buy the shares. The Group Chief Executive
recommends to the Remuneration Committee which 
of his direct reports should also participate in the ARBS.
The performance target for the 2005/6 ARBS is based 
on an earnings per share (EPS) target. 
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
The ESOS was replaced by an LTIP in 2004 and no further
grants of options were made under this scheme during
the year ended 31 March 2006. The participants of the
scheme were the Executive Directors and a number of
senior managers.
Under the scheme, each participant previously received
annual option grants, equating to a percentage of base
salary, which varied according to seniority, up to a
maximum of three times base salary each year. The
exercise of options depends on the group's growth in
earnings per share (EPS, as defined in the scheme rules)
relative to inflation, which the Committee considered to
be the most appropriate way of measuring the group's
underlying financial performance.
EPS targets are measured cumulatively from a fixed base,
initially over a three-year period. Conditions apply, so that
a proportion (one-third) of the options are exercisable if
EPS growth exceeds inflation by a cumulative average of
three per cent per annum, rising to the full vesting of
options if EPS growth exceeds inflation by a cumulative
average of 14 per cent per annum. Between three per
cent and 14 per cent growth, the proportion of options
that may vest increases on a straight-line basis.
The 2001 ESOS did not meet its minimum performance
conditions in the three-year period to 31 March 2004 
or upon retesting following completion of the financial
periods ended 31 March 2005 and 2006 and all
outstanding options made under this award have
therefore lapsed.
The 2002 ESOS did not meet its minimum performance
conditions in the three-year period to 31 March 2005 
or upon retesting following completion of the financial
period ended 31 March 2006. It will be retested in 2007,
but is not expected to vest.
The 2003 ESOS has met its performance conditions in 
full in the three-year period to 31 March 2006. www.awg.com
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
53
Long Term Incentive Plan 2004
The 2004 LTIP was approved at the 2004 AGM and
replaces the ESOS. Under this plan, Directors and senior
managers may receive, at the discretion of the
Remuneration Committee, annual awards of shares
subject to performance conditions. Awards are normally
in the range of 25 per cent to 150 per cent of salary. 
For the 2004/5 award, the proportion of shares that vest
will depend upon the group's performance in terms 
of total shareholder return (TSR).
For the 2005/6 award, the proportion of shares that 
vest will depend 60 per cent upon the group's
performance in terms of TSR and 40 per cent upon 
its performance in terms of EPS. The continued use 
of an element of relative TSR aligns managers' and
shareholders' interests and provides a robust
measurement of performance relative to peers. Linking
vesting of awards partially to real EPS growth is simple,
transparent and motivational for participants. The
Remuneration Committee has reviewed the LTIP and
believes it remains relevant. In determining the award
level, the Committee took into account the fact that the
performance target was upper decile rather than upper
quartile as is usual in comparative schemes.
Vesting of the TSR element of the award is based on the
group's three-year TSR relative to a comparator index
weighted 80 per cent on the five major water companies
which are considered to be the group's closest peers
(Kelda, Northumbrian, Pennon, Severn Trent and United
Utilities). The balance (20 per cent) of the comparator
index is based on the smaller listed water companies and
seven other companies considered to be peers of the
Morrison business (Bristol Water, Dee Valley, Alfred
MacAlpine, Amec, Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Jarvis,
and W S Atkins). The TSR element vests in full only if the
group's three-year TSR exceeds that of the index by at
least 6.5 per cent per year, with 25 per cent of the TSR
element vesting if the group's TSR matches the index.
Between these levels of performance, vesting is based
upon a straight-line sliding scale. None of the TSR
element vests if the group's TSR is below the performance
of the comparator index and there is no re-testing.
The EPS element of the award will vest if dividends are
maintained in real terms throughout the performance
period and then only to the extent that the EPS element
of the performance condition is met. EPS is measured
cumulatively from a fixed base over a three-year period. 
If EPS growth exceeds inflation by a cumulative average 
of three per cent per annum, then 25 per cent of the EPS
element will vest, rising to 100 per cent vesting if EPS
growth exceeds inflation by a cumulative average of seven
per cent per annum or more. No EPS-based shares will vest
if EPS growth is less than a cumulative average of three
per cent per annum above inflation. Shares vest on a
straight-line basis if average EPS growth is between three
per cent and seven per cent per annum above inflation.
As a matter of policy all Executive Directors and recipients
of an LTIP are required to retain a minimum shareholding
in the company, equivalent to annual base salary for
Executive Directors and 50 per cent of annual base salary
for certain senior managers. Fifty per cent of any post-tax
award made under the LTIP will be retained until these
guidelines are achieved.
Service contracts
All Executive Directors have service contracts with a notice
period of one year from the company and six months
from the Executive Director. None of the service contracts
provides for a pre-determined amount of compensation
in the event of early termination.

Performance graph
This graph illustrates the performance of AWG Plc
compared to the FTSE All-Share index. The Committee
considers this to be the most appropriate broad equity
market index for illustrating the company's performance
relative to other companies with a similar market
capitalisation. 
This graph shows the value, by the end of March 2006, of
 100 invested in AWG on 31 March 2001 compared with
the value of  100 invested in the FTSE All-Share Index.
 100 invested in AWG on 31 March 2001 would have
been worth  333 five years later compared with  128 if
invested in the FTSE All-Share Index over the same period.
Pensions
Jonson Cox and Scott Longhurst participate in the AWG
Pension Scheme (Defined Contribution section). Details 
of the amounts paid by the group in respect of these
arrangements are shown below:
2006 2005
 000  000
Jonson Cox 49 58
Scott Longhurst 26 11
For the year ended 31 March 2006, these amounts
represented 46 per cent and 25 per cent of the Inland
Revenue earnings cap for Jonson Cox and Scott Longhurst
respectively. In addition, Jonson Cox receives a pension
allowance which is invested in an unfunded, unapproved,
retirement benefit defined contribution arrangement. 
The combined value of Jonson Cox's contributions is
equivalent to 50 per cent of his salary.
In the event of an employee's death in service, the AWG
Scheme provides for payment of a lump sum equivalent 
to four times salary, together with a pension paid to
dependents. 
Roy Pointer, a former Director, was a member of the Mirror
Image Section of the AWG Pension Scheme (AWGPS), an
exempt approved pension scheme. The Mirror Image
Section's normal retirement age is 65, or as early as age
60 on reaching 40 years' service. The maximum benefits
are attained after 45 years' service, being a pension of 
56 per cent of pensionable salary plus a tax-free lump
sum of 168 per cent of pensionable salary. Pensionable
salary is base salary and benefits, excluding bonus
payments. Pension payments are increased annually in line
with price inflation. Roy Pointer resigned as a Director on
26 April 2005 prior to his retirement from the group on
17 July 2005 and received his normal benefits under the
Scheme Rules.
The pension benefit of the remaining Director in the Mirror Image Section of AWGPS during the year to 31 March 
2006 (rounded to the nearest thousand pounds) is summarised below

Executive Directors' Non-Executive Directorship of a third party
The group encourages its Executive Directors to become Non-Executive Directors of other groups, provided that these
appointments are not with competing groups, or likely to lead to any conflicts of interest, and do not require a level of
time commitment which would prejudice their ability to fulfil their primary role within the group. This serves to add to
their personal and professional experience and knowledge, to the benefit of the group. Any fees derived from such
appointments may be retained by the Executive Director.
In this respect, Jonson Cox was appointed to the board of Wincanton plc on 21 October 2005 and received a fee 
of  20,000 during the year in his position as Non-Executive Director.

Twenty five per cent of the fee paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors is invested in shares in the company. 
To simplify administration all those shares are purchased in a single tranche, in September, and the monthly payments
adjusted accordingly. Consequently the 25 per cent invested in shares represents an advance fee. These shares are
included in the above figures, being at 31 March 2006: Peter Hickson, 6,100 (2005: 3,359); Frances Heaton, 1,704
(2005: 1,007); Jim McKenna, 1,316 (2005: 783) and Andrew Carr-Locke, 1,316 (2005: 783). The Directors must hold
these shares for the duration of their appointment.
