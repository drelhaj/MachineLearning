Section 3: Governance
REMUNERATION REPORT
INTRODUCTION
This report is presented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code) and the
Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations). The Regulations require the auditors to report on the auditable part  of the
remuneration report. The audited information has therefore been separately highlighted.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in written terms of reference based on the model published by the
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which are available on the Group's website and include the following:
 determination of the policy for remuneration of the executive directors and designated senior managers;
 determination of individual remuneration packages for the executive directors and designated senior managers;
 consideration of executive directors' service agreements, pensions and related matters;
 making recommendations to the Board on the design of share incentive plans; and
 exercise of all powers and discretions of the directors in connection with the Company's savings-related and executive share option schemes.
MEMBERSHIP
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were Robin Southwell (Chairman), Norman Broadhurst, Gary Bullard, John Hughes
(appointed 3 February 2009), Paul Lester and Eric Tracey. On Robin Southwell's retirement as a director on 29 July 2008, Gary Bullard took over the
chairmanship of the Committee.
ADVISERS
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives from the Chief
Executive and the Group Personnel Director, neither of whom took part in the determination of their own remuneration. Advice was also received
from the Company Secretary in relation to the operation of the Company's share-based incentive plans. Advice was obtained from Hewitt New
Bridge Street (HNBS), who were appointed by the Remuneration Committee to advise on executive remuneration, and long-term incentive
arrangements, including employee share schemes. HNBS has no other connection with the Company.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed its performance through the process outlined on the corporate governance report
on page 37. The Remuneration Committee considered that it had the skills and experience to perform its responsibilities.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
POLICY ON REMUNERATION
The fees of non-executive directors and the Chairman are determined by the Board and were reviewed during the year. The policy is to set fees
at the median level relative to companies with a comparable market capitalisation. Fees do not contain any performance-related element and the
non-executive directors do not participate in the Chloride Pension Scheme or in the share option or performance share schemes. Additional fees
are paid for chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, reflecting the additional workload and responsibility of these appointments.
Non-executive directors have no entitlement to compensation for early termination of their term of appointment, and take no part in the
determination of their own remuneration.
Details of the fees paid during the year are included in the table headed Summary of Remuneration  on page 46.
The annual fee level for 2009/2010 is unchanged from 2008/2009, as follows:
Fee
Office  000
Chairman 115.0
Non-executive director 36.5
Remuneration Committee chairmanship additional fee 5.0
Audit Committee chairmanship additional fee 6.0 42 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Section 3: Governance
REMUNERATION REPORT
TERM OF APPOINTMENT
The non-executive directors are appointed for specified terms of approximately three years. Their letters of appointment have no contractual notice
period, and the appointment of each non-executive director is subject to re-election by shareholders on retirement by rotation, which occurs every
two years. The dates on which the current respective letters of appointment came into effect are as follows: Norman Broadhurst - 3 April 2007;
Gary Bullard and Eric Tracey - 2 December 2008; Paul Lester - 1 September 2007; and John Hughes - 1 January 2009. Robin Southwell's term of
appointment expired on 20 January 2008, and was extended to 29 July 2008, the date of the Annual General Meeting.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
POLICY ON REMUNERATION
The policy is to provide a combination of salary, short and long-term incentives and benefits, which form a competitive and fair total remuneration
package. Performance-related remuneration in the form of annual bonus, together with share options and performance shares, comprises a
significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity but is only receivable if stretching performance targets, which require substantial
improvement in financial performance and, in the case of performance shares, superior total shareholder return, are achieved.
COMPONENTS OF THE REMUNERATION PACKAGE
BASE SALARY
The base salary of each executive director is reviewed annually, taking into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual together
with independently furnished information on rates for similar jobs in comparable industry sectors. In particular, base salaries recognise salary
levels in a group of comparably-sized companies in the electronics sector and other similar sectors. Details of salaries, bonuses and benefits paid
to executive directors during the year are included in the table headed Summary of Remuneration  on page 46.
The basic annual salaries of Tim Cobbold and Neil Warner with effect from 1 April 2009 are:
T R Cobbold -  350,000
N W Warner -  250,000
These represent a nil increase for Tim Cobbold and Neil Warner.
ANNUAL BONUS
Chloride operates annual incentive plans for certain employees, including executive directors. Eligibility for inclusion in such schemes and the
measures of performance to be used are decided annually, taking account of key business issues. For the year under review, the financial measure
applicable to the incentive plans for executive directors was actual adjusted earnings per share compared with the previous year, with on-target
performance at 10% growth and maximum bonus payable at 28% growth. In 2008/2009 for the Group Finance Director and other senior executives,
up to 25% of maximum bonus was dependent on achievement of personal objectives, in addition to the financial target. The Chief Executive's
bonus is dependent entirely on adjusted earnings per share performance.
For the executive directors and two senior executives, the maximum award under the 2008/2009 annual incentive plan was 100% of base salary.
Bonus amounts earned up to 55% of base salary are paid in cash. If the bonus earned exceeds 55% of base salary, the bonus earned between
50% and 75% of base salary is deferred into shares which are released after two years, subject to the executive director/senior executive
remaining in the Group's employment. Bonus payable in excess of 75% of base salary is payable in cash. Bonus shares earned by the executive
directors under the deferred bonus plan and not yet released by the Company are included in the table headed Interests under Share Plans 
starting on page 47. Bonuses earned by the executive directors and senior executives under annual incentive plans are not pensionable.
The amount of bonus payable under this scheme is dependent on achievement of stretching financial targets and, in the case of the Group Finance
Director and the senior executives, personal objectives also.
SIGNING ON ARRANGEMENTS
Tim Cobbold joined the Group on 1 June 2007 as Chief Operating Officer and as an executive director. In addition to participating in the
performance-related long and short-term incentive plans, life insurance and pension scheme and receiving benefits in kind, he is entitled to receive the
following additional payments in each of the first two calendar years of his employment, to assist with the transition from his previous employment:
A bonus of  50,000, net of income tax (c.  85,000 gross).
A relocation allowance of  42,000. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 43
The Committee considers these payments, which total c.  127,000 per annum gross, to be reasonable having regard to the need to attract
the best candidate for this demanding role. The payments made during the year to 31 March 2009 are included in the table headed Summary
of Remuneration  on page 46.
Mr Cobbold is also entitled to reimbursement of certain costs if he decides to purchase a property closer to the Group head office in London.
BENEFITS IN KIND
The taxable benefits provided to executive directors during the year under review were use of a fully-expensed car or car allowance, life insurance
and medical cover.
PENSIONS
During the year, the executive directors were members of the final salary section of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme (the 1996 Scheme).
This Scheme is a funded, contributory, HMRC-approved, occupational pension scheme, which is contracted into the State Earnings-Related
Pension Scheme. It provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable earnings (up to normal retirement age under the Scheme),
depending on service. The 1996 Scheme also provides for dependants' pensions and lump sums on death in service.
The table headed Pension Entitlements  on page 46 shows the retirement benefits, excluding voluntary contributions, which accrued under the
defined benefit section of the 1996 Scheme to the executive directors during the year, together with the total accrued annual pension to which
each of them would be entitled under defined benefit arrangements on leaving service.
With effect from 6 April 2006, the 1996 Scheme adopted a cap on pensionable salary in place of the statutory earnings cap, which is cost neutral
to the Group. The pension benefits of the executive directors are subject to this cap and they each received salary supplements in relation to salary
in excess of the cap. The amount of these payments is shown in the table on page 46 headed Summary of Remuneration .
EXECUTIVE SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES
POLICY
The Board encourages executive directors to build and maintain holdings of shares in the Company and believes that the potential for increased
share ownership which is provided by share-based incentive schemes is an important element in promoting closer alignment of the interests
of shareholders and executive directors. The policy is to make annual grants of share options and/or performance shares, with a combined annual
aggregate limit on the value of shares under award of two times basic salary. The effect of this overall limit is that an individual cannot receive more
value under a combination of Performance Share Plan awards and Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) grants than he could have under only
one plan. In calculating the value of awards, a performance share is deemed equal to two ESOS awards. For example, an individual could receive
a maximum ESOS option grant of 200% of salary or a performance share grant of 100% of salary. Alternatively, he could receive a 100% ESOS
option grant and a 50% performance share grant to receive the maximum level of award per annum.
SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The current share option scheme is the Chloride Group 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme. Options granted under this scheme are normally
exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, on condition that the Company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS)
growth over a period of at least three consecutive financial years from the date of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by:
 3% a year compound for options over shares worth up to 100% of base salary;
 4% a year compound for options over shares worth over 100% but not more than 150% of base salary; and
 7% a year compound for options over shares worth over 150% of base salary.
In the case of options granted after 31 March 2004, options will lapse if the performance condition is not achieved by the third anniversary of grant.
Adjusted EPS as disclosed in the report and accounts was chosen as the basis for the performance condition because achievement of the growth
in EPS necessary before options may be exercised would require a substantial improvement in the Group's underlying financial performance.
No options were granted to the executive directors under this scheme during the year. 44 ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Section 3: Governance
REMUNERATION REPORT
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
The Group also operates a Performance Share Plan (PSP). The maximum annual value of shares which can be granted under the PSP is 100%
of salary.
Awards granted under the PSP are normally exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of the award, to the extent that a total shareholder
return (TSR) performance target is met over a fixed performance period of three financial years. The TSR target for the years to 31 March 2009
compares the Company's TSR with that of constituents of the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding Investment Trusts). As the Company is now
a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts), the Committee has decided that the Company's TSR should be measured
against that index for awards granted from June 2008 onwards.
Awards vest as follows:
Chloride's ranking % of awards which vest
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Between median and upper quartile Straight line between 30% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
In addition, no awards will vest under the PSP unless the Company's EPS growth is at least equal to the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus
2% p.a. over the performance period.
PREVIOUS EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
Prior to the Chloride Group 2001 ESOS and the PSP, the Company operated the Chloride Group 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 1996 Share
Option Scheme, under which HMRC-approved options and, in the case of the 1996 Scheme, unapproved options were granted to executive
directors as well as senior executives and are still exercisable. No further options can be granted under the 1994 or 1996 schemes. Options granted
under the 1994 and 1996 Schemes are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to meeting the
performance measures stated in the notes to the table headed Interests under Share Plans  on page 47.
SAVINGS-RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Group operates a savings-related share option scheme - the 2007 Scheme, which expires in July 2017. Under the Scheme, options - which
are available to eligible UK employees who contract to save a specified monthly amount - are not normally exercisable until the expiry of three or,
depending on an individual's initial election, five years from the contract start date.
The 1997 savings-related share option scheme expired in July 2007, and no further options can be granted under it.
The outstanding interests of the executive directors under all executive share option schemes, the savings-related share schemes and the PSP
are set out in the table starting on page 47 headed Interests under Share Plans .
CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT
Each of the executive directors has a rolling contract of employment, terminable on 12 months' notice if terminated by the Company and
six months' notice if terminated by the director.
The executive directors' current contracts of employment became effective on the following dates:
Tim Cobbold - 29 July 2008
Neil Warner - 23 April 1997
In the event of termination by the Company, each of the executive directors would be entitled to 12 months' salary, pension benefits, salary
supplement and benefits in kind. In an appropriate case the Company would have regard to the departing director's duty to mitigate loss.
However, the contracts of employment of the directors contain special terms relating to dismissal following a change of control of the Company,
under which they would each be entitled to receive a prescribed payment made up of 12 months' salary and benefits including a bonus payment
of 20% of basic salary. Four senior executives also have contracts of employment containing this formula for a prescribed compensation
payment on dismissal following a change of control.
No compensation payments were made to executive or non-executive directors during the year. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 45
POLICY ON EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The current policy is that executive directors should not take on more than one major outside appointment and then only with the prior approval
of the Board. Fees associated with any such appointment will normally be retained by the individual. During the year, fees received and retained
were as follows:
Fee
 000 Company
Keith Hodgkinson 15.7 De La Rue plc
Neil Warner 36.3 Dechra Pharmaceuticals plc
Mr Hodgkinson's fees relate to the period 1 April 2008 to 29 July 2008, this being the date he retired as a director of Chloride Group PLC.

Notes
1 The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement under the terms of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme based on service to 31 March 2009.
2 The transfer values (and their increases) in columns 6, 8, 9 and 10 have been calculated in accordance with legislation.
3 The difference between the transfer value increase shown in column 6 and column 10 arises from a change in the date of calculation of transfer values and the change in the transfer value
basis adopted by the trustees over the year.
4 The normal retirement age for directors is 65. The transfer values assume that Mr Warner can receive his benefits accrued before 1 April 2006 at age 60 and his benefits accrued after
31 March 2006 at age 65 and that Mr Cobbold receives his benefits at age 65.
5 Mr Hodgkinson retired as an employee on 30 November 2008. The accrued pension and transfer value amounts shown above are calculated as at this date based on the pre-commutation
retirement benefits payable from this date.
The transfer values shown in the above table are a liability of the 1996 Scheme. The above table combines the disclosures required by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Directors' Remuneration Regulations 2002. ANNUAL REPORT 2009 47
