Remuneration report 
45 
This Report will be submitted for approval at the AGM on 10 July 2008. 
Remuneration Committee 
Who is on it? 
The members of the Committee throughout the year (each served throughout the year) were all independent Non-Executive 
Directors: 
D J Shah (Committee Chairman)  
J Rennocks 
Sir Nigel Essenhigh 
J Crookenden 
Their biographical details are on page 36. Each member attended the three formal meetings of the Committee during the year  
and took part in informal meetings as necessary. 
What does it do? 
The Committee determines the remuneration packages of the Chairman, Executive Directors and certain other senior  
Group executives. 
How does the Committee operate? 
The Committee meets formally at least twice a year. The Committee also meets on an ad hoc basis as may be necessary.  
The Company Secretary attends meetings as secretary to the Committee. The Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive  
attend formal meetings by invitation of the Committee, except when their own remuneration is being discussed. The Deputy 
Chairman attends some meetings as an observer. 
The Inbucon Group Limited ( Inbucon') provides the Committee with independent, market-based advice on director and senior 
management remuneration. Inbucon is formally retained, with the Committee's approval, by the Company (acting through the 
Company Secretary). Inbucon does not provide other services to Group companies.  
What is the Company's remuneration policy? 
The remuneration policy for executives has two objectives: 
  to ensure that the remuneration structure for senior executives is competitive, so that when taking account of job complexity, 
responsibility, skills and experience, the remuneration package is at least at a similar level for comparable post holders in the  
market in which the Company has to compete in recruiting and retaining such executives; and 
  where the Company achieves or exceeds predetermined performance criteria, to share with those executives a fair proportion  
of the value of that performance. 
The link between remuneration policy and strategy is made through the performance criteria used in both the annual bonus  
and long-term incentive schemes with the intention that executives have remuneration packages overall that are fair and allow 
enhanced rewards for the delivery of superior performance. 
Level and balance of remuneration 
Market comparison 
In reviewing remuneration, the Company considers data relating to both companies generally of a similar size as well as to 
remuneration specifically in the support services sector. 
Level of remuneration 
The Committee sets the level of overall remuneration so that upper quartile rewards can be earned for upper quartile performance, 
having set basic packages bearing in mind the median for comparable companies.   Babcock International Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008

46 
Balance of remuneration 
The balance of remuneration for Executive Directors is set so that the major part of overall remuneration is subject to performance, 
both short- and long-term. The balance for the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director is shown in the graphs below,  
(with L-TIP awards being valued on a projected value basis and assuming full achievement of bonus potential). 
 
 
Mr Campbell, as part-time Chairman, has a remuneration package in which the performance related element is over 50% of  
potential remuneration. 
Internal relativity 
The Committee is sensitive to the need to set Directors' remuneration having regard to pay and conditions in the Group as a whole 
and is satisfied that the approach taken by the Company is fair and reasonable in light of current market practice and the best interests 
of shareholders.  
Basic pay 
Basic pay is considered against comparable companies in terms of size (comparing revenues, number of employees and market 
capitalisation), and companies in the support services sector. Against these data sources taken as a whole, the Company's basic pay  
is at or about the median. Basic pay is reviewed annually. 
In June 2007, the Company made a major strategic move when it acquired Devonport Management Limited (DML ) and its 
subsidiaries. This acquisition transformed the size of the Group. The Committee therefore asked Inbucon to carry out a review to 
ensure that in the changed circumstances remuneration packages remained in line with remuneration policy when tested against 
relevant comparative data. The salary for Mr Tame had already fallen behind market before this step-change in the size of the Group 
and the increase in his remuneration also reflects this.  Babcock International Group PLC

Performance-related rewards 
Annual bonus schemes 
Of the Directors, only Mr Rogers, Group Chief Executive, and Mr Tame, Group Finance Director, receive annual bonuses. These are 
performance-related and the scheme is set by the Committee each year.  
The Committee's policy is currently to focus the schemes on profit and/or earnings growth.  
For the year ended 31 March 2008, the annual bonuses payable to Mr Rogers (maximum 100% of eligible salary) and Mr Tame  
(80%) were originally structured as follows: a bonus of 20% was dependent on hitting budgets for profit before tax and cash flow.  
The balance (80% for Mr Rogers and 60% for Mr Tame) depended on growth in profit before tax over the prior financial year,  
with maximum pay-out for this element being achieved at 20% growth in profits. 
However, the acquisition of Devonport Management Limited (DML) part-way through the year made a meaningful and appropriate 
year-on-year profits growth comparison difficult. The DML acquisition was financed in part by a placing of newly-issued shares and in 
part by borrowings. 
Against this background, the scheme was amended to provide for maximum bonus to be paid if the revised Group budget, inclusive  
of DML, was achieved with no diminution in actual earnings per share (before exceptionals and amortisation of acquired intangibles)  
as against the original pre-acquisition budget for earnings per share. 
Mr Rogers and Mr Tame earned maximum annual bonus for financial year 2007/08.  
For the financial year 2008/09 the Committee is again setting annual bonuses for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame principally by reference to 
growth, using growth in earnings per share (before amortisation of acquired intangibles, but, unless the Committee otherwise decides, 
after exceptionals) (EPS), with the balance by reference to hitting profit before tax and cash flow budgets. The relative proportions as 
between reward for growth and reward for achieving budget will be as described above. Maximum bonus will be paid for achieving 
budget and 20% growth in EPS.  
Annual bonus schemes for divisional managing directors also include performance measures dependent on growth in divisional  
profits and/or achievement of budgeted divisional profits and cash flow according to the objectives for the division concerned.  
Bonus schemes for senior Group managers other than Directors reflect the schemes for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, but with lower 
maximum bonus potential. 
The Committee has discretion to reduce or extinguish bonuses in light of health, safety or environmental performance. 
Annual bonuses are not pensionable. 
Long-term incentives 
Each year since 2003, qualifying Directors and certain senior Group employees have been granted performance-related long-term 
incentives in the form of awards of nil-price options under the Babcock 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( L-TIP'). Before 2003 they  
were granted performance-related market-priced share options under the Babcock 1999 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share 
Option Schemes. 
It is the intention of the Company that shares needed to satisfy options for Directors and awards under the L-TIP will be purchased  
in the market to the extent not already held in the employee share trusts at the date the options or awards were granted or  
are exercised. 
During the financial year, L-TIP awards were made to each of Mr Campbell, Mr Rogers and Mr Tame over shares having a market  
value on award of 100% of their qualifying basic salaries. Awards were also made to a small number of other senior managers. 
The vesting of the L-TIP awards depends on company performance. Half of each award vests according to comparative  
Total Shareholder Return performance (against a specific comparator list) and half on earnings per share growth. The performance 
criteria are set out on page 52.  
Details of options and L-TIP awards held by the Directors are set out on pages 50 and 51.  
For certain divisional senior managers, but not the Company's Directors, there is a cash-based long-term incentive scheme focused  
on divisional performance and with particular features to aid retention. The performance targets are set by reference to divisional  
profit targets and return on capital employed or operating cash flow, as most appropriate to the division's business. A similar scheme  
is in place for senior Group employees (but not the Company's Directors) based on EPS growth over the performance period.  
Target bonuses under these schemes vary between participants but will not normally exceed a year's basic salary for on-target 
performance, with maximum payout for out-performance capped at 150% of target bonus.   Babcock International Group PLC

Performance graph 
The graphs below were prepared by Inbucon. They show the total shareholder return for a holding in the Company's shares for  
the period from 1
 
April 2003 to 31 March 2008 relative to a holding of shares representing respectively the FTSE All-Share Index 
(excluding investment trusts) and the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector. The calculation of the return assumes dividends are reinvested 
to purchase additional equity. This FTSE All-Share Index (excluding investment trusts) is the same index as has been used for this 
purpose in earlier Remuneration reports, as it is a broad index that allows comparison of the Company's performance against the 
performance of the stock market as a whole. Support Services is the sector in which the Company's share price is reported. 
Over the five-year period, the Company has substantially out-performed both indexes. An investment of  100 in the Company on  
1 April 2003 would have been worth (assuming the dividends were reinvested in further Company shares)  721 at 31 March 2008.

The fees for Lord Hesketh reflect his additional duties as Deputy Chairman. Mr Rennocks' and Mr Shah's fees reflect their additional 
duties as Chairmen of, respectively, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee. 
Bonus payments and benefits in kind are not pensionable. 
Directors' pensions (audited) 
Only Mr Tame currently participates in a Group pension scheme. He receives a salary supplement for his earnings in excess of the 
scheme earnings cap (see the table on page 48).  
Mr Rogers receives a supplement in lieu of pension, which is not taken into account for the purpose of bonus or L-TIP awards.  
It is separately identified in the table on page 48. 
The Company's policy is to remain competitive in the market place to attract and retain the calibre of employee it needs.  
Subject to that, it is not the Company's policy to compensate Directors for tax changes or changes to the taxation of pensions. 
Babcock International Group Pension Scheme ( the Scheme') 
Mr Tame is a member of the senior executive tier of the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme. No other Directors are 
members of the Scheme or receive pension benefits from the Group. 
The accrual rate for Mr Tame under the Scheme is one-thirtieth for each year of service, with pension being calculated on his base 
salary (up to the Scheme's  earnings cap') in the 12 months prior to attaining age 60. Membership of the Scheme also entitles him  
to life assurance cover of four times base salary up to the earnings cap. The earnings cap adopted by the Scheme is the same as the 
former statutory earnings cap, index-linked in the same way. The Company takes out additional life assurance cover in respect of four 
times his salary in excess of the earnings cap.  
Mr Tame's pension entitlements under the Scheme (defined benefit) are set out in the following table:

1.  Inflation has been taken as 3.9% for the purposes of calculating increases in transfer values and pension earned. 
2.  The transfer value of the increase in pension accrued is calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, and is stated after deducting  
members' contributions.  
3.  The figures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benefits under the Scheme. 
4.  The figures in the above table make no allowance for any benefits in respect of earnings in excess of the Inland Revenue earnings cap. 
5.  In calculating the above figures for Mr Tame no account has been taken of any retained benefits which he may have from previous employments. 
6. No payments have been made to retired Directors in excess of the retirement benefit to which they were entitled on the date the benefits first became payable or,  
if later, 31 March 1997. 
Other pension arrangements (audited) 
Before 1 April 2006, the Company provided a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS) for Mr Tame in respect of  
his salary in excess of the earnings cap. The Company contributed to the FURBS an amount equal to 20% of the excess (including 
employer's national insurance contributions), with Mr Tame making contributions into the Company's pension scheme on his full 
uncapped salary. As from April 2006, this was replaced with a salary supplement of 15% of the excess (including employer's national 
insurance contributions), with Mr Tame contributing into the Company's pension scheme only on capped salary.  
The cost of providing additional life assurance cover was:

Options vested according to comparative TSR performance over three-year performance periods. They were not subject to re-testing. 
The comparator group was the companies in the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector when the options were granted (which  
was the sector in which the Company's shares were then listed). There was no vesting unless the Company ranked above median 
performance, in which case 25% of the options vested. Full vesting was for top quartile ranking with proportionate vesting on  
a straight-line basis for a ranking between those points.  
The exercise price was set at the average of the mid-market closing price of the Company's shares for the three business days 
preceding the date of the grant. This price was not discounted. 
Directors must exercise vested options before the tenth anniversaries of the grant dates, or earlier if there is a change of control,  
they leave or die, failing which they will lapse.  
There were no changes in the Directors' share options between 31 March 2008 and 27 May 2008.

2.  The L-TIP awards shown in italics were fully vested and exercisable as at 31 March 2008. 
3.  Vesting date depends on the date of notification of the vesting, but will be after announcement of results for the final year of the applicable performance period.  
The above table assumes that the announcement is made in May and notification of vesting given in the same month. 
The Company's mid-market share price at close of business on 31 March 2008 was 571.50p. The highest and lowest mid-market 
share prices in the year ended 31 March 2008 were 617.50p and 400.00p respectively. 
The L-TIP awards that vested during the year to 31 March 2008 were those granted in July 2004. The market value of those shares  
on award was 126.00p per share. On the date of vesting, 16 May 2007, they had a market value of 549.00p per share, being the 
mid-market closing price on that day. The performance conditions attached to the awards are described below. 
All the L-TIP awards made to Directors to date have been made by the trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust as conditional 
rights to acquire shares (effectively nil cost options). The number of shares awarded had a value equal to the qualifying annual salary  
at the date of the award using the average of the mid-market closing price of the Company's shares for the three business days 
preceding that date.   Babcock International Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 
Remuneration report continued 
52 
Subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria (see below) attached to the awards, the Directors may call for the release of the 
award shares during the above exercise periods. Subject to the rules of the plan, an earlier release of shares may be allowed by the 
Remuneration Committee (for example, in the event of a cessation of employment or a change in control), but normally of not  
more than a time-apportioned proportion and then only having regard to the Company's performance, though the Committee  
has discretion to allow a greater proportion to be released. 
Performance measures attached to L-TIP awards 
Performance is judged over the period of three financial years from the start of the financial year in which the award is made. 
Performance is measured at the end of the period and is not re-tested. 
For L-TIP awards made after 2003, half of each award vests according to comparative TSR performance measured against a specified 
list of companies with similar businesses (see below), and half according to growth in earnings per share. This approach will be taken 
with any awards made in financial year 2008/09.  
For the half of the share awards where vesting depends on comparative TSR performance, a ranking immediately above the median 
level in the comparator table results in 25% of those shares vesting. There is no vesting for ranking at or below median. A ranking  
in the top quartile results in 100% vesting. Rankings between these threshold levels result in proportionate vesting calculated on  
a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%.  
The comparator group of listed companies for the 2004, 2005 and, (apart from PHS Group) 2006 comprised AEA Technology,  
W.S. Atkins, Aggreko, Amec, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, Cobham, Interserve, Laing (John), Mitie, Mouchel-Parkman, PHS Group,  
Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group, and WSP Group.  
The comparator group for the awards made in 2007 was: 
1. AEA Technology      11. Mouchel Parkman 
2. Atkins       12. Rentokil Initial 
3. Aggreko      13. SERCO Group 
4. AMEC       14. VT Group 
5. Bodycote International     15. WSP Group 
6. Capita Group      16. The Weir Group PLC 
7. Carillion      17. Ashtead Group plc 
8. Cobham      18. Alfred McAlpine plc 
9. Interserve      19. Davis Service Group plc 
10. MITIE Group 
The comparator group is chosen by the Remuneration Committee with a view to giving an appropriate range of support services 
providers against which to compare the Company having regard to the nature of its and their businesses. The Group will be reviewed 
before the grant of awards in 2008. 
The TSR calculation uses a 12-month average. The Company feels that this is the most appropriate period because a 12-month 
average ensures both that the short-term market volatility is excluded and that for each company a 12-month period will capture the 
impact of the announcement of results and payment of dividends. A shorter period would not capture all these events and would not 
necessarily put all companies on an equal footing. 
For the half of the post-2003 L-TIP awards where vesting depends on earnings per share growth, 25% of the shares vest if that growth 
(adjusted to exclude exceptional items and acquired intangible amortisation) over the performance period is equivalent to a real  
(i.e. in excess of the growth in the consumer prices index) compound annual growth rate of 4%, with full vesting if this reaches 8%. 
Vesting is on a straight-line basis for growth between those two points. There is no vesting for compound annual earnings per share 
growth of below 4%.  
For the L-TIP awards made in 2003 vesting depended on the Company's earnings per share (pre-acquired intangible amortisation  
and exceptional items) in the year to 31 March 2006 being at least 9.27% (representing a 3% per annum compound growth rate) 
greater than the basic earnings per share (pre-acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items) for the financial year to  
31 March 2003. Once this hurdle was achieved, actual levels of vesting depended on the comparative TSR performance of the 
Company as at 31 March 2006 against the shares of the companies comprising the FTSE All-Share Index (other than Investment Trusts) 
on 1 April 2003. The target provided for no vesting at or below median ranking, 25% vesting for immediately above median ranking 
and 100% vesting for top quartile ranking (with proportionate straight-line vesting in between).   Babcock International Group PLC

Service contracts 
The following table summarises the key terms (apart from as to remuneration) of the Chairman's and Executive Directors' service 
contracts or terms of appointment: 
Chairman and Executive Directors 
Name Date of service contract Notice period Contractual retirement age 
G A Campbell 
(Chairman) 
31 July 2003 (amended by 
letters dated 5 May 2004 
 and 3 April 2006) 
12 months from Company, 6 months from Director 65 
P L Rogers  
(Group Chief Executive) 
31 July 2003 (amended by 
letters dated 5 May 2004 
 and 3 April 2006) 
12 months from Company, 6 months from Director 65 
W Tame  
(Group  
Finance Director) 
20 September 2001 (amended 
by letters dated 5 May 2004 
and 3 April 2006) 
12 months from Company, 6 months from Director 65 
The Company's policy is that Directors' service contracts should be capable of being terminated by the Company on not more than  
12 months' notice.  
If the Company terminates a Director's service contract (other than following a change of control or by the exercise of the Company's 
option to pay salary in lieu of notice - see below) the Company will have regard to all the circumstances in determining the amount of 
compensation, if any, payable to him in connection with that termination. The agreements for Mr Campbell, Mr Rogers and Mr Tame 
contain provisions relating to termination following a change of control, as described below. These provisions do no more than reflect 
what would, in effect, be a likely outcome in practice for these positions following a change of control and may contain the liability in 
such case, as the payment is limited to base salary and for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, 40% in lieu of bonus, which is significantly less than 
their actual bonus potential. 
The contracts provide that within 90 days of the occurrence of the change of control the Director may terminate his employment 
forthwith. If he exercises this right, he is only entitled to be paid his basic salary (plus, in the case of Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, 40% in  
lieu of bonus and all other contractual entitlements) on a monthly basis, but any amount that he receives by way of income from  
other sources within that 12-month period, if it exceeds 10% of salary, that he would not have been able to earn had he continued  
in employment with the Company, is deductible from the amounts otherwise payable by the Company. If the Company terminates 
the Director's appointment within 12 months of a change of control, the Director is entitled to a termination payment equal to  
100% of his annual salary (plus, in the case of Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, an additional 40% in lieu of bonus and all other benefits).

*The Company's policy is for Non-Executive Directors to have written terms of appointment normally for no more than three-year 
terms at a time; however, in all cases appointments are terminable at will at any time by the Company or the Director.  
The latest written terms of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office and at the Company's Annual 
General Meeting. The expected time commitment of Non-Executive Directors is set out in their current written terms of appointment.  
Outside directorships 
Before taking up any new outside appointment, an Executive Director must first seek the approval of the Chairman. Any fees for 
outside appointments are retained by the Director. Mr Tame, Executive Director, is a Non-Executive Director of Carclo PLC. During the 
period 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 his fees for that role were  25,000.

Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group and a true and 
fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of affairs of the Company for that 
period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
  state whether the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and with regard to the parent 
company financial statements whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements.  
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the

legislation in other jurisdictions.
