Report on Remuneration and Related Matters
This report meets the requirements of the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 ( the
Regulations'). It also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice ( the
Combined Code') relating to Directors' remuneration. The Combined Code was issued in July 2003 and
applied to Antofagasta plc during the 2004 financial year.
During the year under review, the Company complied with the detailed code provisions set out in Section B
of the Combined Code except as follows:
  As explained on page 62, performance related pay measures did not apply to all Executive Directors
(provision B.1.1); and
  Until Mr. R F Jara stood down from the Remuneration Committee and was replaced by Mr. D E Yarur on
10 May 2004, the Remuneration Committee was not comprised entirely of independent Non-Executive
Directors (provision B.2.1).
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the  auditable part' of this
report and to state whether in their opinion that part has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into separate
sections for unaudited and audited information.

Remuneration Committee 
Membership
The membership of the Remuneration Committee during the year was as follows:
Mr. G S Menendez (member throughout the year and Chairman from 10 May 2004);
Mr. C H Bailey (member throughout the year and Chairman until 10 May 2004);
Mr. D E Yarur (member from 10 May 2004);
Mr. R F Jara (member until 10 May 2004).
Mr. Menendez, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Yarur were considered by the Board to be independent Non-Executive
Directors throughout 2004.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are fully set out in its Terms of Reference which are
available on the Company's website. The Committee is responsible for setting remuneration policy and
reviewing the remuneration of the Executive Directors and in doing so, it consulted Mr. A A Luksic, who
was the Chairman of Antofagasta plc until 5 November 2004 and now consults the current Chairman,
Mr. J-P Luksic. The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for monitoring the level and structure of
remuneration of Group senior management.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole. No Director
participates in the determination of his own remuneration.  Report on Remuneration and Related Matters

Company Policy on Directors' Pay and Bonuses
The Company's policy is to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded with regard to responsibilities
undertaken, and considers comparable pay levels in the United Kingdom and in Chile. Corporate and
individual performance are taken into account in setting pay levels for each Executive Director, and this is
reviewed on an annual basis. In determining pay levels for Non-Executive Directors, the time commitment
and responsibilities undertaken are taken into account.
The Board did not consider it appropriate to make regular performance-related pay awards such as bonuses
to either Mr. A A Luksic (who stepped down from the Board on 5 November 2004) or Mr. P J Adeane. One
Executive Director, Mr. J-P Luksic, received an annual bonus for 2004 in his capacity as Chief Executive
Officer of Antofagasta Minerals S.A. based on personal and divisional performance. Mr. J-P Luksic stepped
down as Chief Executive Officer of Antofagasta Minerals S.A. on 26 November 2004 following his
appointment as Chairman of Antofagasta plc. The bonus is paid to Goldstream Finance Limited and is
disclosed in the remuneration table on page 64. 
The Group has paid Mr. R F Jara for advisory services to the Group. It has also retained Jara del Favero, a
law firm of which Mr. R F Jara was a partner for part of the year, to provide legal services to the Group.
The Board has taken these payments into account in determining his fees as a Non-Executive Director.
No Directors currently receive pension contributions. 
Service Contracts
Mr. J-P Luksic has a contract for services with the Group which replaced his employment contract with
Antofagasta Minerals S.A. in November 2004 after he stepped down as Executive President (Chief Executive
Officer) of that company. The current contract for services has a one month notice period.
There is also a contract between Antofagasta Minerals S.A. and Portos Inversiones Ltda. for the provision 
of advisory services by Mr. R F Jara which also has a one month notice period.
No other Directors have service contracts with the Company and therefore no other notice periods apply.
Share Options and Long-Term Incentive Schemes
No arrangements exist either to enable Directors to acquire benefits through the acquisition of shares in the
Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, to benefit through profit-related pay or share option
schemes or to participate in any long-term incentive schemes. ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004

Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the performance of the FTSE All Share
Index over a five-year period, measured by total shareholder return (as defined below). The FTSE All Share
Index has been selected as an appropriate benchmark as it is the most broadly based index to which the
Company belongs and which relates to the London Stock Exchange, the market where the Company's
ordinary shares are traded.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show a theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a
specified period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares at the closing price
applicable on the ex-dividend date. Total shareholder return for the FTSE All Share Index is calculated by
aggregating the returns of all individual constituents of the FTSE at the end of the five-year period.
