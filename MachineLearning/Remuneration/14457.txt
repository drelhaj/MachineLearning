 The board presents its report to shareholders on the remuneration 
of the directors for the year from 1 October 2004 to 30 September
2005. Shareholders will be invited to approve the report at the Annual
General Meeting on 24 January 2006.

The committee
The Remuneration Committee (the committee) was re-established 
on 7 July 2005 when the former Remuneration and Nomination
Committee was divided into two committees. All the members of the
committee are independent non-executive directors. The chairman of
the committee is Sir Richard Packer KCB and the other members are 
P E B Cawdron and G C Summerfield CBE. Each member of the
committee exercises an independent judgement and has no potential
conflict of interest. The committee and its predecessor body met on
six occasions during the year. P E B Cawdron missed two meetings
and G C Summerfield missed one meeting.
The performance of the committee was evaluated as part of the
formal board evaluation process. This process, which is supervised by
the Nomination Committee, takes place annually in April and involves
all board members replying in confidence to a written questionnaire.
Individual views are not made known to the Nomination Committee.
On behalf of the board the committee reviews and approves the
remuneration, terms of service and other employment benefits for 
the executive directors, the senior management group and other
senior staff. The committee aims to ensure that the company's
executive directors and senior managers are fairly and competitively
rewarded for their individual contributions to the company's overall
performance. The committee also determines the broad policy for
executive remuneration within the company. The committee's terms 
of reference are available on the company's website.
The committee is advised on remuneration practice by New Bridge
Street Consultants, who are engaged as advisers to the committee.
New Bridge Street Consultants monitor the company's performance
against a comparator group, which they select from food processors
and other FTSE 250 companies of comparable size, and advise 
the committee on a regular basis. The committee also receives 
advice as required from the company's advisers, Ashurst (solicitors) 
on procedural and contractual matters, CMS Cameron McKenna
(solicitors) and Watson Wyatt (consultant actuaries) on 
post-retirement benefits.
Remuneration policy
The committee's policy, based on the considerations embodied in 
the Combined Code, is to provide competitive remuneration packages
thereby enabling the company to attract and retain high calibre
executives, while at the same time ensuring that the interests of
shareholders are protected. Incentive awards are designed to
encourage improvements in financial performance and to align the
interests of executive directors and senior managers with those of
shareholders. The policy takes into account the company's total
remuneration bill and employment conditions.
In determining the level of remuneration the committee receives
independent advice from its retained external remuneration consultants
and from other independent sources. The policy takes into account the
remuneration practices of a broad range of comparable companies and
the views of shareholders. The committee reviews the remuneration
policy on a regular basis. Salaries are reviewed annually at 1 October.
The remuneration opportunities for executive directors include basic
salary and benefits, an opportunity for an annual short term incentive,
participation in a long term incentive plan, pension benefits, and
service contracts. Thus a significant proportion of the total executive
package is based on variable pay.
Basic salary and benefits
In establishing and reviewing the salaries and benefits for each
executive director the committee takes account of relevant market 
pay practices, the individual's performance and the company's overall
performance. The relevant information in respect of each director is 
set out in the notes to this report.
Short term incentive plan (annual bonus)
The committee sets annual group incentive targets for executive
directors each year, which aim to enhance business performance and
which take account of current business plans and market expectations.
The maximum available payment is made if the target is exceeded by
15 per cent. No payment is made if the company's performance is less
than 95 per cent of the target. 
The award for executive directors for achieving the target is 30 per cent
of base salary. Where performance is above target the incentive may
increase up to a maximum, at 115 per cent of the target, of 60 per cent
of base salary. Two thirds of any payment is normally made in cash and
one third as a conditional award in shares. These are held in trust for
two years and are not received if the individual leaves the company in
specified circumstances. Incentive payments are not pensionable. The
committee has adopted a policy of extending the short term incentive
plan to a wider group of managers at 50 per cent of the level paid to
executive directors.
No payments under the plan were made in respect of the year ended
30 September 2005.
Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
A long term incentive plan (LTIP) established in 1998, which operates
over a three year cycle starting annually, is designed to align the 
long-term interests of senior management with those of shareholders. 
The LTIP is not approved by HM Revenue and Customs. The number
of shares awarded to a participant in the plan in any financial year is
determined by the committee. The existing arrangements are that the
maximum value of shares that may be awarded to a participant in 
any new cycle will be limited to 1 x prevailing base salary. This is kept
under review by the committee in the light of market conditions.
Under the plan the committee awards shares in the company to the
senior management conditional on the achievement of a corporate
performance target over a period of three years. The performance
target is determined by the committee, on the advice of New Bridge
Street Consultants, as being appropriate for the company's size and
sector. It requires the company's total shareholder return (TSR) over 
the performance cycle, based on movement in the share price and 
the gross value of dividends declared, to be compared with the
average TSR of a comparator peer group of food producers over 
the same performance period. The TSR allows a direct comparison
over an extended period of time between the returns received 
by the company's shareholders and the returns received by
shareholders in other food companies in the comparator group,
thereby aligning the interests of the executive directors with those 
of the company's shareholders.
Arla Foods UK plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 
25
Remuneration report Arla Foods UK plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 
26
The comparator group currently consists of the following companies in
the FTSE Food Producers Index:
The current performance target requires the TSR, over the three year
performance cycle, to rank in the top quartile of the comparator
companies in order for participants in the plan to be entitled to all the
shares comprising the award. If the company's performance is ranked
at 50 per cent or lower no awards are made. Where the company is
placed between 50 per cent and the top quartile the number of
shares is calculated on a straight line basis, with 33 per cent being
received where the company is placed at 51 per cent and all the
award being received where the company is placed in the top quartile.
The TSRs are independently calculated by New Bridge Street
Consultants and participants receive regular reports on the company's
comparative position. Adjustments are made if necessary to allow for
changes in the comparator group. The committee has discretion to
decide whether the underlying performance of the company justifies
an award being made. In considering this the committee will have
regard to the real growth in the company's earnings per share over
the performance period. If an award is not earned in accordance 
with the performance conditions outlined above then it will lapse.
Shares awarded under the plan after the three year performance
period are at present purchased in the market and are retained in trust
on behalf of the participants for a further two years. During this period
participants are entitled to receive any dividends payable on the shares
and to instruct the trustee how to vote. At the end of this retention
period the shares are transferred to participants from the trust.
The present policy of the committee, which is under review, is that
employees who receive awards under the LTIP in any financial year 
will not be considered for grants of options under the company share
option plan.
The interests of the executive directors in the LTIP awards made 
over the last five years, including a conditional award made on 
6 January 2005, are set out on page 31. The award made on 
11 July 2002 vested at 100 per cent in May 2005.

The graph shows the value, up to 30 September 2005, of 
 100 invested in Arla Foods UK plc (formerly Express Dairies plc) on 
31 March 2000 compared with the value of  100 invested in the FTSE 
All Share Index. The other points plotted are the values at intervening
financial year ends.
As at 30 September 2005 the LTIPs granted over the past three 
years, if at the end of their cycle, would vest as follows: 2003 
LTIP 100 per cent, 2004 LTIP 0 per cent, 2005 LTIP 33 per cent.
Share options
Replacement scheme
Following demerger in 1998 a new share option scheme was adopted
by the company to replace the Northern Foods Executive Share Option
Scheme 1994. No change to that scheme has been made since then
and no re-testing has taken place. The scheme is Inland Revenue
approved. There is also an unapproved element if options granted
exceed Inland Revenue limits. Both directors and other senior
management may participate in the scheme, as determined by the
committee. No share options have been awarded under the scheme
since 1998 and the final options awarded under the scheme lapsed
on 7 April 2005. No options were exercised during 2005, 2004, 2003,
2002 or 2001. The scheme is now at an end.
Savings-related scheme
A savings-related share option scheme with Inland Revenue 
approval was also established in 1998 open to all eligible employees. 
All options under the scheme lapsed no later than 1 April 2004 and
the committee does not intend to grant further options.
Company share option plan
In July 2004 the shareholders approved the Arla Foods UK plc
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP). The CSOP was approved by 
HM Revenue and Customs on 30 September 2004. There is also an
unapproved element if options granted exceed Revenue limits. Both
directors and other senior managers may participate in the CSOP, as
determined by the committee, subject to individual limitations. 
The CSOP is subject to performance criteria relating to the growth in
earnings per ordinary share (EPS) over a performance period of three
years measured against the growth in the retail prices index (RPI). 
The calculation will be undertaken by New Bridge Street Consultants. 
EPS was chosen because it provides a measure of real improvement 
in the company's financial performance and any grants made will be
subject to appropriate and challenging performance conditions. The
current intention is that options should not normally be exercisable 
in full unless the company's normalised growth in EPS exceeds the
growth in the RPI by at least seven per cent per annum compound
over three years, with partial exercise on a sliding scale being
permitted where growth in EPS exceeds growth in the RPI by at least
three per cent per annum compound over three years. No options 
will be exercisable if the company's performance falls below this level.
The performance criteria are measured from a fixed base date and 
no re-testing is permitted. The exercise price of an option under the
scheme will not be less than the market value of a share at the date
of grant. Subject to the performance conditions being achieved
options are exercisable between the third and the tenth anniversary 
of the date of grant. Shares awarded under the scheme will be issued
by the company.
Awards were made under the CSOP on 6 January 2005. In
accordance with the committee's policy no grants were made to
executive directors.

As at 30 September 2005, according to New Bridge Street
Consultants, if at the end of its performance period, the CSOP 
would have vested at 100 per cent.
The CSOP replaced a company share option plan approved in 1998
which terminated in July 2004.
Share incentive plan
In July 2001 the shareholders approved a share incentive plan, which
came into operation in April 2004. The plan is open to all employees
with continuous service of six months. Three directors and a number 
of senior managers participate in the plan and the interests of the
directors are set out on page 30.
The plan allows the company to provide additional matching shares
when employees purchase partnership shares through regular
contributions from salary under the scheme, up to a maximum
permitted sum of  125 per month. For the year 2005/06 the plan is
offered on the basis of one matching share for two partnership shares.
The partnership shares are held in trust for a minimum of three years.
Otherwise the matching shares may be forfeited.
Pensions
The company operates a number of pension schemes. Certain 
eligible employees including T J Smith and M J Gilbert are members 
of the Express Ltd defined benefit scheme while other eligible
employees including H Sondergaard are members of the Arla Foods
Ltd defined benefit scheme. Employees who have joined the company
since a specified date (31 January 2002 for Express Ltd, 1 January
2002 for Arla Foods Ltd) including N D Peet and S D Stevens have
been eligible only to join a defined contribution or stakeholder plan.
Pensionable earnings are calculated on base salary only. The amount
of accrued pension for each director is set out on page 29, together
with comparative amounts adjusted for inflation.
The company will introduce certain simplifications and other
modifications to the pension schemes with effect from 6 April 2006. 
In particular a pensionable salary cap based on the current earnings
cap will be retained following the abolition of the earnings cap. 
This will be adjusted annually in line with movements in the retail
prices index. 
Service contracts
T J Smith entered into a new service contract with the company in 
July 2004. This provides for one year's notice except that this rises to
18 months in the special case of termination by Arla Foods amba in
the two years following October 2005. On becoming Chief Executive 
T J Smith has agreed in principle to replace this with a service contract
providing for 12 months' notice in all circumstances, subject to
agreement between him, the company and Arla Foods amba. Apart
from T J Smith, all executive directors have 12-month notice periods.
The service contract of M J Gilbert expires on 1 June 2006. As at 
30 November 2005, the unexpired term of M J Gilbert's contract was
182 days. It is intended that N D Peet and S D Stevens will enter, in
due course, into full service contracts providing for one year's notice.
The company's policy, to the extent consistent with its contractual
obligations, is to apply the principle of mitigation to any payments 
of compensation on termination. The service contract of T J Smith
provides that no mitigation shall be applied if he leaves the company 
as a result of termination of the contract. Compensation is calculated 
by reference to salary and benefits payable over the notice period. 
The LTIP scheme sets out the rules to be followed on termination of
employment, based upon the reason for termination in individual cases,
and the annual incentive plan where applicable accrues on a time basis.
T J Smith is a non-executive director of an external company as
disclosed on page 22. The company's practice is that an individual
retains his fees, which in this case amounted to  12,840.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed for two years but may be
eligible for reappointment. The remuneration fee for non-executive
directors is determined by the board as a whole, based on the time
commitment, but non-executive directors do not take part in the
discussion on their own remuneration. Non-executive directors do 
not participate in the company's incentive plans or share schemes. 1. Directors' remuneration

Notes to the table
(1) The accrued pension for R C N Davidson, T J Smith and M J Gilbert as at 30 September 2005 includes an inflationary increase of 2.7% over 
the period to 30 September 2004. The accrued pension for H Sondergaard includes an inflationary increase of 3.1% over the period to 
30 September 2004.
(2) The company provides executive directors with a pension, which is payable at age 60, equal to two thirds base salary, reduced where 
service to age 60 is less than 20 years. Member contributions are 5% of base salary each year. Death in service cover is a lump sum of 
four times pensionable earnings. On the death of a director, or a retired director, a spouse's pension of 50% would be payable.
(3) Early retirement may be granted with the consent of the company and the Trustees of the Express Pension Scheme from age 50 but benefits
are reduced by 4% pa for ages 50 up to 59 years. Once in payment, pensions are increased in line with price inflation up to a ceiling of 
3% pa in respect of pensionable service accrued to 31 March 1997 and price inflation up to a ceiling of 5% pa on service accrued thereafter.
The Trustees, with the consent of the company, have discretion to apply such greater increase as they consider appropriate.
(4) The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 less directors'
contributions.
(5) For T J Smith it is anticipated that his full entitlement as shown above will exceed the Inland Revenue maximum earnings cap for the 
Express Pension Scheme. Funded and unfunded unapproved arrangements are in place to provide the balance of the total entitlements above
the amount payable from the Express Pension Scheme. In total,  57 ,000 was paid into T J Smith's unapproved arrangements in the year.
6) N D Peet and S D Stevens are members of defined contribution pension schemes. Employers' contributions of  14,532 and  14,940
respectively were paid in the year.

has been reduced by any contributions paid by the director over the year and includes the effect of fluctuations due to factors beyond the
control of the company and directors, such as stock market movements. 2. Directors' interests
