 The auditable part of the remuneration report is set out on pages 35 to 38.
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
Membership and constitution of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the independent non-executive directors (Mr R E Hough, Committee chairman, 
Mr C D Collins and Mr P H Swatman), all of whom served throughout the year. Mr Hough succeeded Mr Collins as chairman of the
Committee on 1 May 2005. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the Company's overall framework for the
remuneration of executive directors and certain key senior executives, and determines the individual remuneration packages of the
executive directors (including pension rights and compensation payments). The Committee also reviews and sets the fee payable to the
chairman of the Company. The Committee consults the group chief executive on the remuneration of the executive directors and
senior executives, and is assisted by the group company secretary. 
With effect from October 2005, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (NBSC) was appointed to advise the Committee in place of
Inbucon Consulting and Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited (Mercer). NBSC provided no other services to the Company
during the year. Inbucon Administration continues to support the operation of the Company's existing discretionary share plans. 
In relation to pension matters, the Company is advised by NBSC and OAC plc (Oxford Actuaries and Consultants). Mercer provides
advice to Mr I M Grice in relation to his own pension arrangements. Neither the Committee nor the Company is aware of any conflict
of interest arising from these appointments. 
Compliance
The Committee is constituted and operates in accordance with the provisions of Section B of The Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the Code) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. In preparing this report, the Board has complied with the provisions
of the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the Code.
A copy of the Committee's terms of reference may be downloaded from the Company's website or obtained from the group 
company secretary.
Executive remuneration policy and structure
The Group's aim is to provide remuneration packages that are sufficient to attract, motivate and retain executive directors of a high
calibre. To this end, surveys and external advice are instrumental in the annual review of remuneration packages. The Committee
believes that base salary and benefits for executive directors should represent a fair return for employment, but that the total reward
for executive directors should be derived substantially from the performance related elements of the remuneration package (annual
bonus and awards of shares under a long term incentive plan). The policy adopted by the Committee is that executive directors' base
pay should be around the median and that performance related incentives may bring their total remuneration to the upper quartile.
Performance related elements therefore form a material proportion of the executive directors' total remuneration packages, aligning
their interests with those of the shareholders and providing incentives for performance. In designing schemes for performance related
remuneration, the Committee follows the provisions of the Code. 
There have been no amendments to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a director under a long term incentive scheme
(the Restricted Share Plan or the Long Term Incentive Plan 2005) during the year.
Performance chart
The chart below, which has been prepared by NBSC, compares the growth in value (assuming that dividends are re-invested) of  100
invested in ordinary shares in Alfred McAlpine plc on 1 January 2001 with the performance of a similar investment in the shares of the
constituents of the FTSE Construction and Materials Index and the FTSE Support Services Index. The directors are of the view that these
constitute relevant broad equity market indices.

Value ( )
Alfred McAlpine plc Base salary
The salary of each executive director is determined by the Committee, taking into account his personal performance and the prevailing
rates in the employment market for executives of comparable status, responsibility, skill and position in other relevant companies.
When determining directors' salaries the Committee is always sensitive to pay and employment conditions throughout the Group. 
The Committee receives independent advice on salary levels in relevant companies for executive directors and senior executives. The
most recent survey indicated that the base salaries of the executive directors were slightly below the median when compared with
their peers. Base salaries were reviewed with effect from 1 January 2006 and are now broadly around the median.
Annual bonus
The Committee reviews the targets for the executive directors annually. For 2005 and 2006, bonuses for the executive directors are
based on growth in the Group's profit before tax (before the effect of any non-recurring items) and, if the director is responsible for 
a business stream, profit before tax (PBT) at the level of that business stream compared with budget. For 2005, it was agreed that no
Group performance related bonus would be payable unless growth in PBT exceeded 3%. This trigger point has been raised to 5% 
for 2006. The maximum bonus achievable by executive directors is 100% of salary, which in 2006 would require 20% growth 
(2005: 20% growth) measured against the previous year's PBT. The bonus earned by reference to growth in PBT is scaled back by up
to 20% if targets based on key performance indicators are not met. The key performance indicators selected are: reduction in the
accident frequency rate; achievement of budgeted cashflow; and improvement in employee satisfaction levels as measured by the
annual employee survey. This bonus structure is deemed to be relevant, stretching and designed to enhance the business. 
Pensions policy 
During 2005, the executive directors participated in the McAlpine 2003 Pension Plan (the 2003 Pension Plan), which is a contracted-in
defined contribution pension arrangement. The 2003 Pension Plan is operated on behalf of the Company by Zurich Corporate
Pensions and is subject to the Stakeholder Pensions regulations. The Company contribution in respect of the executive directors 
was 21% of base salary, up to the level of the earnings cap ( 105,600 in the 2005/06 tax year). All pension benefits were subject to
Inland Revenue limits, and the Group maintained its policy of providing those executives who joined the Company after May 1989 
and who were subject to the earnings cap, with appropriate pension benefits outside the pension arrangements outlined above 
in relation to that part of their salary which exceeded the earnings cap. This was achieved by establishing a funded unapproved
retirement benefit scheme (FURBS) for each individual or, more recently, by paying a  pension supplement' for the executive to invest 
as he considered appropriate. In respect of Mr Grice and Mr Swan, the Company agreed in 1995 and 2002 respectively to target a
pension of two thirds of final salary at normal retirement age. Such commitments, which were common at the time, will not be
repeated. Details of the pension benefits provided for individual directors may be found on pages 35 and 36.
Under the provisions of the Finance Act 2004, the earnings cap will be replaced by a lifetime limit on the size of the fund that can 
be used to pay pension benefits to any individual, and an annual limit on the contributions that may be paid into registered 
pension arrangements for the benefit of any individual. With effect from 6 April 2006 (the date on which these changes take effect,
sometimes referred to as A-Day), it is the Group's intention to use one or more  registered' pension arrangements, such as the 2003
Pension Plan, and/or salary supplements.
Longer-serving executive directors and senior executives also have final salary pension benefits under the Alfred McAlpine Pension 
Plan (the Final Salary Pension Plan), which was closed to future accrual on 31 July 2003. Members of the Final Salary Pension Plan 
as at that date retain the link to pensionable salary at their eventual date of leaving in respect of service up to 31 July 2003, but have
ceased to accrue benefits within the Final Salary Pension Plan in respect of service after 31 July 2003.
Life assurance cover of four times base salary is provided to members of the 2003 Pension Plan, whilst in service with the Group.
Dependants' pensions are provided on a member's death in service or in retirement. In addition, executives who were formerly
members of the Final Salary Pension Plan are currently provided with a further life assurance cover of two times base salary, on death
in service, which must be used to provide a dependant's pension.
The Company's policy is that the cost of operating pension arrangements for executive directors and senior executives should not
increase as a result of any changes in pension legislation, nor will executive directors be compensated for any adverse effect of these
changes upon their existing pension arrangements. The Remuneration Committee also takes into consideration the impact of base
salary increases upon pension and associated employment costs.
Executive directors retire at age 62.

Alfred McAlpine plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Share schemes 
The Company operates a number of share schemes.
During 2005, the first awards were made under the Alfred McAlpine Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 (LTIP 2005), which was approved
by shareholders at the AGM in 2005 and replaces the Alfred McAlpine plc Restricted Share Plan. Entitlements under the Restricted
Share Plan will continue to vest in accordance with its rules, but no further awards will be made. 
Participants in the LTIP 2005 will not normally receive discretionary options in the same year. 
No options were granted during the year under the Alfred McAlpine Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 (ESOS 2000), which
reached the end of its five year lifespan on 11 May 2005. A number of options are outstanding under the ESOS 2000 and also 
under the Alfred McAlpine Executive Share Option Scheme (1991) (ESOS 1991), which preceded the ESOS 2000. Although a new
discretionary option scheme, the Alfred McAlpine Share Option Scheme 2005 (ESOS 2005), was approved by shareholders at the 
AGM in 2005, no options have yet been granted under this scheme.
The Company also operates an all-employee share scheme, the Alfred McAlpine Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1998, further
details of which may be found in note 21 on page 70. At the AGM in 2000, shareholders approved a share incentive plan to be
known as the Alfred McAlpine Partnership Share Scheme 2000, implementation of which will commence during 2006.
Awards granted under the LTIP 2005 on 23 June 2005 constituted rights over 796,472 ordinary shares, representing 0.80% of the
Company's issued ordinary share capital at 1 January 2005. No awards or options were granted under any other share plan during 
the year. In settlement of rights under share plans or bonus arrangements, a total of 769,386 ordinary shares (representing 0.77% 
of the ordinary shares in issue at 1 January 2005) were issued to participants during the year.
On the transition to IFRS, the Committee has ensured that a consistent basis is used in the measurement of performance
conditions for all incentive plans.
LTIP 2005
The LTIP 2005 was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2005, and the first awards were made on 23 June 2005. 
An award made under the rules of the LTIP 2005 represents a conditional right to receive ordinary shares in the Company at the end 
of a three year period, provided that two distinct performance conditions are satisfied and the participant remains in the Group' s
employment. The value of an award at the date of grant may not exceed 100% of the recipient's base salary in that year. The
performance conditions used link participants' interests with those of the shareholders by encouraging an increase in the total
shareholder return (TSR) of the Company relative to a peer group of companies and also in the earnings per share (EPS) of the Group. 
The Committee believes that TSR and EPS are appropriate performance measurements, being two key long term indicators of the
Company's success.
The three year period over which performance is measured commences with the last day of the Company's financial year immediately
preceding the date on which an award is made, and ends on the last day of the Company's financial year immediately preceding the
third anniversary of the award date. TSR is calculated by taking the percentage increase in the Company's share price over the three
year performance period, plus the reinvestment value of dividends paid. The Company's performance is then measured against that 
of a peer group of companies, the majority of which are direct competitors. The peer group for the LTIP 2005 comprises: 
AMEC plc Carillion plc Jarvis plc Mouchel Parkman plc
WS Atkins plc Costain Group plc Kier Group plc Mowlem plc*
Babcock International Group plc Enterprise plc John Laing plc Rok property solutions plc
Balfour Beatty plc Galliford Try plc MITIE Group plc Serco Group plc
Birse Group plc Interserve plc Morgan Sindall plc WSP Group plc
*Mowlem plc ceased to be listed on the London Stock Exchange on 23 February 2006, following its acquisition by Carillion plc. For the purposes of TSR measurement relating to awards
made before that date, the value realised on each Mowlem share (measured in cash and Carillion shares at completion of the transaction) will be treated as if invested in a notional index
based on the residual members of the comparator group. For awards made after 23 February 2006, Mowlem plc will be deleted from the comparator group.
If the Company's TSR performance over the three year performance period places it below the median, the award lapses. For
performance at the median, only 30% of the award is deemed to have satisfied the TSR performance condition, and the balance
lapses. Potential vesting rises on a straight line basis from 30% at the median to 100% for performance at or above the upper
quartile. However, an award is then only able to vest if the EPS of the Group has also increased over the performance period by 
at least 3% compound per annum in excess of the Retail Price Index (RPI). If this second performance condition is not satisfied, 
the award lapses.
The TSR calculations for the LTIP 2005 will be independently calculated and verified by the Committee, as are those for the Restricted
Share Plan.

Alfred McAlpine plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 The Restricted Share Plan
The Restricted Share Plan was approved by shareholders on 22 May 1996, and no initial awards have been made since 22 April 2004. 
Awards made under the terms of the Restricted Share Plan represent a conditional right to receive ordinary shares in the Company,
provided that the Company satisfies specific performance conditions and the participant remains in the Group's employment. 
The maximum value (based on market value at date of award) of shares over which an initial award was made to a participant in 
any year did not normally exceed 50% of salary, awards of a higher value requiring shareholder approval. Typically, initial awards 
were made each year following the preliminary announcement of the full year results, but they have been made at other times when
the Committee believed them to be justified.
The performance condition used to determine the vesting of initial awards is TSR, and the peer group was amended following the 
sale of the Homes business on 1 October 2001, as shown below.
Original comparator group (to 2001):
AMEC plc Costain Group plc Montpellier Group plc Taylor Woodrow plc
Beazer Group plc* Interserve plc Morrison Construction Group plc* Wainhomes*
Birse Group plc Kier Group plc Persimmon plc Westbury plc
Bryant Group plc* John Laing plc Speedy Hire plc George Wimpey plc
* Beazer Group plc, Bryant Group plc, Morrison Construction Group plc and Wainhomes were all taken over after the start of the performance periods for the Restricted Share Plan awards.
Wainhomes was not included as a comparator company for awards made after 1999. 
Amended comparator group (2002 onwards):
Amey plc* Birse Group plc Interserve plc MITIE Group plc 
W S Atkins plc Costain Group plc Jarvis plc Morgan Sindall plc
Balfour Beatty plc Galliford Try plc Kier Group plc Serco Group plc
* Amey plc ceased to be listed on the London Stock Exchange on 26 June 2003, following its acquisition by Ferrovial Servicios SA. 
Vesting may take place from the third anniversary of the initial award date. No awards vest if the Company's performance is
below the 50th percentile. Vesting may start at the 50th percentile, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the initial
award at the 40th percentile. If the Company's performance exceeds the 40th percentile, the number of shares represented 
by the award increases on a proportionate basis, so that at zero percentile (when the Company ranks first in the comparator
group) it is equal to 150% of the initial award. These additional rights are known as exceptional performance awards. 
The rules allow for re-testing every six months between the third and seventh anniversaries of the initial award date.
If initial awards and exceptional performance awards that have satisfied the performance condition remain in the Alfred
McAlpine Employee Benefit Trust (the Employee Benefit Trust) for a further three years as deferred awards, then they may 
be matched on a one-for-one basis, provided that the growth in EPS of the Group exceeds the growth in RPI by 9% or 
more over the three year deferral period.
It is the current intention of the Committee that the TSR and EPS performance criteria described above continue to apply to the
Restricted Share Plan.
Where initial awards and exceptional performance awards remain in the Restricted Share Plan as deferred awards, the trustee 
of the Employee Benefit Trust has waived its entitlement to dividends on the shares represented by these awards, but the
Company may elect to make a discretionary payment to the participant.
ESOS 2005
The ESOS 2005 was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2005. No options have yet been granted under this scheme.
The ESOS 2005 provides for discretionary options (with a maximum value of 100% of base salary per annum) to be granted
over ordinary shares in the Company, at the market price prevailing at the date of grant. The performance condition attaching
to these options requires the Company's EPS, measured over a three year period to grow by at least 3% compound per annum
in excess of inflation. At this level, only 30% of an option would be exercisable. For options to be exercisable in full, the 
Group's EPS (measured over the same period) would have to grow by at least 5% compound per annum in excess of inflation.
For EPS between these thresholds the exercisable proportion of an option would be calculated on a straight line basis. Any
option, or part of an option, failing to satisfy the performance condition at the end of the three year period lapses. 
ESOS 2000
Senior executives are granted discretionary options over ordinary shares in the Company, at the market price prevailing at the
date of grant. The performance condition for the ESOS 2000 requires the Group's EPS growth to exceed the growth in RPI by
not less than 3% per annum over a rolling three year period in order for the options to be exercised. No further options will be
granted under this scheme.

to retain their shares after exercising share options or after vesting under the Restricted Share Plan, subject to the need to fund the
acquisition of the shares and any associated tax and national insurance liability. When making awards under the LTIP 2005, the
Committee takes into consideration the number of shares retained by an individual from earlier awards and options.

Alfred McAlpine plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 The Alfred McAlpine Employee Benefit Trust was established in 1998 and may benefit employees, including the executive
directors, of the Group. The trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust is able to subscribe for or purchase shares to fulfil obligations
under any of the Company's share schemes. The trustee is Mourant and Co Trustees Limited, based in the Channel Islands. 
As at 31 December 2005, 1,608,444 ordinary shares in the Company were held by the trustee. As potential beneficiaries, 
the executive directors are each deemed to have a beneficial interest in all of the shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust.

On 11 January 2006: Mr Swatman made an open market purchase of 2,500 ordinary shares in the Company at a price of
387.55p per share; the trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust transferred 1,841 ordinary shares to Mr Whitehead and 1,534
ordinary shares to Mr Grice; and the trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust sold, at a price of 386.4027p per share, a further

(ii) Retirement benefits above the former Inland Revenue earnings cap have been provided through a FURBS and/or salary supplement paid to the relevant director. Mr Lavelle, Mr McGilvray,
Mr Robertson and Mr Swan each received a supplementary payment from the Company to enable them to make their own provision in respect of salary above the earnings cap. 
Mr Grice and Mr Whitehead each have a FURBS.
(iii) Mr Hume resigned as a director on 30 October 2003. In mitigation of Mr Hume's contractual entitlement to two years' notice under the terms of his service agreement dated 
1 October 1998, the Committee agreed it was appropriate to continue payment of salary and benefits to Mr Hume on a month by month basis. In the event of Mr Hume commencing
prior to 30 October 2005 alternative employment that was comparable with his former position with the Company, the Company undertook to make a lump sum payment to Mr Hume
equivalent (after an adjustment to offset remuneration earned by Mr Hume since 1 November 2003) to 50% of the salary and benefits then outstanding under his notice period. 
Mr Hume commenced comparable alternative employment on 6 June 2005. A final lump sum payment of  135,328 is due in respect of Mr Hume's salary and benefits in kind
outstanding as at 6 June 2005 under his contractual notice period, as mitigated by the Committee. This has been included in the amount shown above. Mr Hume also has an
entitlement to shares covered by certain awards granted under the Restricted Share Plan which will be released to him during 2006.

Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN 11 issued by the actuarial profession.
The value of the net increase in column (4) represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at the year
end. It is based on the accrued pension increase in column (2) and allows for the deduction of the director's contribution.
The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as stock market movements,
and is calculated after deducting the director's contribution.
Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
