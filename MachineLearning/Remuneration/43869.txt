Directors' Remuneration Report
This report sets out the information required by the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The Report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions relating to directors' 
remuneration in the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance. As required by the Regulations, the Directors' Remuneration Report 
will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2010.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on certain parts of the Directors' Remuneration Report and to 
state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. 
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for the audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee comprised:
Mr I F R Much (Committee Chairman)
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman
Mr K C Scobie (resigned 25 March 2009) 
The Committee's principal responsibilities are:
  determining, agreeing with the Board and reviewing from time to time the overall policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, 
the executive directors, the Company Secretary and certain other senior executives in the Group, and their individual remuneration 
packages and any changes thereto;
  approving the terms and conditions of employment, and any changes thereto, of the executive directors; 
  approving any compensation payments for executive directors;
  approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group;
  reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and the Company's shareholders; 
  providing oversight of potential remuneration-related risks arising across the Group; and
  overseeing any major changes in employee benefits structures across the Group.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest in the matters reserved for the Committee nor do they have 
any conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, and they are not involved in the day to day running of the Group's business. 
Therefore, they are regarded by the Board as independent.
The Committee met six times during the year. The Chairman and Chief Executive attend meetings by invitation but are not present during 
any discussions relating to their own remuneration. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company's website or on request from the Company Secretary.
Advisers
During the year the Committee received advice on remuneration matters from Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The Committee also consults internally with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The Committee's policy is to provide executive remuneration packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by reference to market 
rates across comparator companies, reflect the performance of the business against financial objectives, and which take into account the 
individual contribution and performance of each executive director. Remuneration packages comprise the following elements:
(i) base salary and benefits, including pensions;
(ii) annual bonuses linked to the Group's financial performance; and 
(iii)  awards of share-based incentives linked to the long term growth of the Group.
The Committee aims to align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders, by ensuring that a significant 
proportion of remuneration is performance-related. This is achieved through the performance-related elements of annual bonuses 
and share-based incentives. Corporate governance

Key decisions reached by the Committee during the year in relation to ongoing remuneration arrangements for the executive directors 
are summarised below. 
Base salary: The Committee considered, in particular, the performance of the Group, the prevailing economic conditions and the need to 
maintain market competitive salary levels. Against this background, base salary increases for the executive directors were limited to 5% 
with effect from 1 April 2009. 
Pension provision: The Committee has agreed that with effect from 1 April 2010, the executive directors will cease to participate in 
the Group's defined benefit pension scheme, and will instead, for all future service, receive a salary supplement of 20% of base salary. 
Whilst these levels of contributions enhance the short-term fixed costs to the Company relative to the existing defined benefit pension 
arrangements, there is clearly an advantageous and offsetting transfer of investment risk to the individuals. 
As a result of these two changes, the overall level of fixed pay for the executive directors in the forthcoming year will be closer to, but still 
below, the median of the market benchmarks used by the Committee (benchmarks which take into account both market capitalisation and 
turnover, and which have therefore increased less for the Group than would have arisen if based solely on market capitalisation). 
Annual bonus: Executive directors will be required to receive 40% of any bonus earned in 2010 in the form of deferred shares 
(an increase from 25% in 2009). All other key aspects of the bonus scheme remain unchanged.
Share awards: Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, share awards worth (at grant) up to 125% of base salary 
will be granted to the executive directors in 2010 (within an increased normal annual award limit of 150% of salary). Awards will continue 
to be subject to highly challenging earnings per share growth targets.
More details on each of these changes are outlined below. 
Comparator groups
The constituents of the sector-based comparator group utilised by the Committee for remuneration benchmarking purposes during the 
year were as follows:
Charter International plc Rotork PLC
Chloride Group PLC  Spectris plc
Halma p.l.c.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc
IMI plc   Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Meggitt PLC  VT Group plc 
Melrose PLC  The Weir Group PLC
QinetiQ Group PLC
The Committee also considered general comparator groups based on FTSE 250 companies with a similar market capitalisation and turnover. 
Base salaries and benefits
The executive directors' base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if appropriate, taking into account 
individual performance and comparable salary levels in the comparator groups set out above. The Committee refers to published salary 
surveys and data provided by its remuneration advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, and also reviews the remuneration information 
presented in the annual reports of companies in the comparator groups. 
The executive directors' current base salaries are as follows:
  Dr D J Price  420,000 (2008:  400,000)
  Mr P A Rayner  262,500 (2008:  250,000)
The executive directors' base salaries will next be reviewed on 1 April 2010.
The Committee also considers and approves the base salaries for nineteen other senior executives, and reviews salaries for the next tier 
of management at each of the Group's businesses. The Committee therefore has due regard for salary levels across the Group in applying 
its remuneration policy.
The main taxable benefits for executive directors are fully-expensed company cars and private medical insurance.

Annual bonuses
During the year under review, the Company operated an annual performance-related bonus plan for the executive directors, with key 
characteristics as follows:
  a maximum bonus potential for the executive directors of 100% of base salary;
  three quarters of the bonus potential linked to two separate financial performance conditions, namely earnings per share and cash flow 
(with equal weighting). The conditions, which are set by the Committee, take into account a number of factors including budget, market 
expectations, long term growth prospects and the previous year's out-turn. No bonus is payable for achievement of less than 90% of 
target, with bonuses being earned thereafter on a straight-line basis up to the maximum for 110% or better achievement of target;
  one quarter of the bonus potential may be achieved in connection with the satisfaction of personal objective criteria set at the 
beginning of the financial year. These comprise a mixture of short term and longer term objectives linked to the delivery of the 
Company's strategic plan. No part of this element of bonus is payable unless threshold performance of both the financial conditions 
described above is achieved. The personal objectives set for the executive directors during the year were linked to the following 
strategic objectives:
 - growth of the Group's order book, and development of the Group's sales and marketing capabilities;
 - formation of the new International Division, and establishment of joint ventures;
 - delivery of margin improvements and increased cash flow generation; 
 - management of capital projects;
 - improvements in the Group's environmental performance; and
 - strengthening of the Group's balance sheet; 
  one quarter of any bonus payable is deferred as a conditional award of the Company's shares, with vesting subject to continued 
employment (save in good leaver scenarios) three years from the award of bonus; and 
  the payment of any bonus remains ultimately at the discretion of the Committee.
Bonuses are non-pensionable.
The table below summarises the bonuses earned by the executive directors, as a percentage of base salary, in respect of the current and 
last years (the figures in brackets are the maximum percentages that could have been achieved):
 2009 2008
Bonus percentage received for: D J Price P A Rayner D J Price P A Rayner
Earnings per share performance 35.63  (37.5) 35.63  (37.5) 19.1  (22.5) 19.1  (22.5)
Cash flow performance 37.5  (37.5) 37.5  (37.5) 22.5  (22.5) 22.5  (22.5)
Achievement of personal objectives 21.0  (25.0) 21.25  (25.0) 10.5  (15.0)  12.7  (15.0)
Total 94.13  (100.0) 94.38  (100.0) 52.1  (60.0) 54.3  (60.0)
The Committee continues to set highly challenging bonus targets for the achievement of maximum bonuses. Despite the outstanding 
levels of EPS growth and returns to shareholders delivered by the Group in recent years, the executive directors have not received 
maximum bonuses in any of the last four years as evidenced by the chart below.

The basic structure of the bonus scheme will remain unchanged for the current financial year, namely with a maximum bonus potential 
of 100% of base salary. However, in order to reflect emerging best practice, the proportion of any bonus earned by the executive 
directors to be satisfied by the award of deferred shares will increase from 25% to 40%. Bonuses will continue to be determined by 
a mixture of earnings per share, cash flow and personal objectives. Corporate governance

Performance share plan
The Company operates the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan for the executive directors and other key members of the senior 
management team who influence the performance and prospects of the Group. The key features of the plan are currently as follows:
  conditional awards can be made of the Company's shares worth no more than 100% of base salary each year;
  awards will vest three years after grant subject to the extent to which a demanding performance condition has been achieved over a single 
three year performance period (with no ability to re-test the performance condition). The performance condition is based on the growth of 
the Company's earnings per share in excess of RPI over three consecutive financial years. The Committee considers an earnings per share 
condition to most closely align the interests of participants with those of the Company's shareholders;
  the vesting schedules for awards granted to date are as follows:
Total earnings per share growth per annum  
(not compounded) over three financial years
Threshold vesting Full vesting
Awards made prior to 23 January 2007 RPI +5% (33% vests) RPI+15%
Awards made on 24 January 2007 RPI +7.5% (33% vests) RPI+20%
Awards made on or after 23 January 2008 RPI +10% (25% vests) RPI+30%
No shares vest for growth below the threshold vesting target. Vesting is calculated on a straight-line basis for growth between the 
threshold and full vesting targets;
  earnings per share is calculated on a fully diluted and normalised basis, as specified by the Committee prior to grant; and
  market purchase shares or new issue shares (including treasury shares) may be used to satisfy awards. To the extent that new issue 
shares or treasury shares are used, these will count towards the usual share usage dilution limits (10% in ten years for all schemes 
and 5% in ten years for discretionary (executive) schemes).
Participation in the plan is extended at the discretion of the Committee to the executive directors and senior management of the Group, 
both in the UK and overseas. The following awards were made under the plan during the year:
Date of award
Total number of  
shares awarded
Number of participants 
receiving awards
21 January 2009 150,404 31
24 June 2009 12,653 3
Total 163,057 34
Details of the awards made to executive directors during the year are set out on page 46. 
The Committee remains committed to ensuring that it offers a suitably attractive pay package to its senior executives, aligned to 
shareholders' interests through the use of significant levels of potential variable pay triggered by exceptional levels of performance. 
The performance share plan was originally introduced when the Company was a Small Cap company and the maximum award level was 
set accordingly. As an established FTSE 250 company, the existing maximum award of 100% of base salary is now below market norms, 
and the Board will therefore be seeking shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2010 for an increase in the 
potential maximum level of future awards under the plan as follows:
  in normal circumstances, to permit maximum awards over shares worth up to 150% of base salary for an individual; and
  in exceptional circumstances, such as on recruitment, to permit maximum awards over shares worth up to 200% of base salary.
If these changes are approved, the initial grant policy will be for no awards worth more than 125% of base salary to be made in normal 
circumstances. Any proposed change from this policy in future years will be disclosed by the Committee in the Directors' Remuneration Report.  Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2009

Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information
In considering the performance condition for awards which will be made in 2010, the Committee has considered the forward prospects for 
the defence industry around the world in the context of possible tightening of Government budgets caused by the recent financial crisis, 
whilst acknowledging that the outlook for the Group remains good. As a consequence, it is intended that the target for full vesting of 
awards worth up to 100% of salary will reduce marginally to RPI+25%. However, the Committee will continue to use a target of RPI+30% 
for full vesting of any award made above the existing 100% of base salary limit. The following vesting schedule will therefore apply for 
awards made in 2010: 
Total earnings per share growth per annum  
(not compounded) over three financial years
Percentage of the total number of shares 
under an award that vest
Less than RPI + 10% Nil
RPI + 10% 25%
RPI + 25% 100% (for awards of up to 100% of base salary)
RPI + 30% 100% (for awards of up to 125% of base salary)
These targets remain among the most demanding performance criteria anywhere and reflect the Committee's ongoing commitment to setting 
appropriately challenging targets for executives to pursue. 
The Committee reviews, from time to time, the basis of the performance condition but continues to believe that the earnings per share 
metric mostly closely aligns the interests of executives and shareholders, and therefore remains an appropriate metric for the Group. 
During the year under review, the Company purchased 78,301 (2008: 160,000) treasury shares at a cost of  1.5 million for use in the plan. 
115,170 shares were transferred from treasury to participants in the plan during the year on vesting of the award made on 23 March 2006. 
The executive directors are expected to build-up, over a five year period following appointment, and maintain a shareholding in the 
Company equivalent to one year's base salary. Both of the executive directors currently hold shares significantly in excess of this 
requirement. Other participants in the plan are expected to retain a shareholding equivalent to 25% of their basic salary following vesting 
of the awards. 
Other schemes
The Company operates all-employee savings-related share schemes in the UK (the Chemring Group 2008 Sharesave Plan) and the USA 
(the Chemring Group 2008 US Stock Purchase Plan). There are no performance criteria for these arrangements, and options are issued to 
all participants in accordance with UK HM Revenue and Customs and US Internal Revenue Service regulations. 
The Company previously operated a long term incentive scheme known as the Chemring Group PLC Share Based Incentive Scheme. 
This scheme is not being utilised at present.
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines contained within Executive Remuneration - ABI Guidelines on Policies and Practices . 
At 31 October 2009, awards outstanding and issued under all share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 3.43% of the 
ordinary share capital of the Company. At 31 October 2009, awards outstanding and issued under executive share schemes during the 
previous ten years amounted to 3.17% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.

Pensions
Dr Price is currently a member of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme (the Staff Scheme ). This is an approved final salary 
scheme, which is contracted out of the State Second Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up to two-thirds of salary, 
subject to Inland Revenue limits. The Staff Scheme also provides life assurance cover, dependants' pensions and lump sum payments 
on death-in-service. Members of the Staff Scheme are required to make monthly contributions to the scheme at the rate of 8% of 
pensionable salary.
Dr Price's pension under the Staff Scheme accrues at 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of membership, and he also accrues a 
cash lump sum at 3/80ths of final pensionable salary for each year of membership. On death-in-service, Dr Price's dependants would receive a 
lump sum payment of two times base salary and, in addition, a 50% spouses' pension would be payable. Dr Price is subject to an earnings cap 
(equivalent to the cap applied by HM Revenue and Customs prior to April 2006) in respect of his membership of the Staff Scheme.
Mr Rayner was a member of the Chemring Group Executive Pension Scheme until it merged with the Staff Scheme on 6 April 2009, at which 
time he became a member of the Staff Scheme. Mr Rayner's benefits under the Staff Scheme accrue in an identical manner to that in which 
Dr Price accrues benefits under the Staff Scheme, as set out above, save that Mr Rayner is not contracted out of the State Second Pension and 
a two-thirds' spouses pension is payable in respect of his service accrued to 31 January 2004, reducing to 50% for service accrued thereafter. 
Mr Rayner is also subject to an earnings cap. 
Both Dr Price and Mr Rayner have a normal retirement age of 65.
The Committee has previously referred to the fact that the current pension arrangements for the executive directors under the 
Staff Scheme (1/80ths accrual rate only as far as the notional earnings cap) are well below market norms, and as explained above, this 
is a contributory factor in the relatively low level of their overall fixed pay. The Committee has therefore agreed that with effect from 
1 April 2010, the executive directors will cease to participate in the Staff Scheme, and will instead, for all future service, receive a salary 
supplement of 20% of base salary. 
Service contracts
Dr Price has a rolling service contract dated 4 April 2005. This provides for termination by either party on twelve months' notice. 
The Company may however terminate without notice, and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of the salary due for 
the unexpired notice period plus the fair value of any contractual benefits. Any such sum may be paid in instalments, and in these 
circumstances there is a requirement to mitigate loss.
Mr Rayner has a rolling service contract dated 27 August 1999. This provides for termination by either party on twelve months' notice. 
The Company may however terminate without notice and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of twelve months' salary plus 
the value of any contractual benefits. There are no other provisions relating to compensation on early termination.
It is the Committee's general policy that all new executive directors appointed in the future will have service contracts with the Company 
which are terminable on a maximum of twelve months' notice. The service contracts will contain provisions permitting the Company to 
make any termination payments by instalments, and will require directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
Policy on outside appointments
With the specific approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of 
other companies, provided that they do not detract from their responsibilities to the Group, and may retain any related fees paid to them. 
Neither of the executive directors currently holds any such external appointments.
Non  executive directors
Mr Scobie has a service contract with the Company which will expire at the conclusion of the Company's Annual General Meeting in 
March 2010. The Board has previously announced that it has commenced the search for Mr Scobie's successor when he retires, and his 
current contract will therefore be extended on a rolling-basis until a successor is appointed. Mr Scobie's remuneration under the contract, 
part of which is paid to his company for consultancy services, is  131,250 per annum. He is required to devote such time to his role as is 
reasonably necessary for the proper performance of his duties. 
Mr Evans, The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss have letters of appointment covering, amongst other 
items, their terms of appointment and expected time commitment. These letters of appointment provide for three year appointments, 
unless terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party upon three months' written notice. The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much 
and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss are currently serving their second three year terms as non-executive directors, which will expire on 
25 May 2012, 30 November 2010 and 30 April 2010 respectively. Mr Evans' current three year appointment as a non-executive director 
will terminate on 30 March 2012. 
The basic fee payable to each of the four non-executive directors is  42,000 per annum. The Rt Hon Lord Freeman and Mr Much each 
receive an additional fee of  7,000 per annum, in respect of their Chairmanship of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee 
respectively. During the year Mr Much was appointed as the Senior Independent Director but he receives no additional fee for this role.
Fees for the non-executive directors are determined annually by the Board, having regard to the practice of other companies and the 
particular demands of the Group.
The Company provides private medical insurance for Mr Scobie, Mr Evans and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, and their respective spouses.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's pension, bonus or share-based incentive schemes. However, Mr Evans does 
receive a pension from the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme, which he accrued during his former employment with the Company.  Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2009

price on the date of vesting was 2,055p. The value of the vested award, and therefore the gain on vesting, to Dr D J Price was  458,697 and to 
Mr P A Rayner was  293,557.
Awards were granted during the year on 21 January 2009. 25% of the shares under award will vest if earnings per share growth is RPI+10% p.a. 
over the three year performance period, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for growth of at least RPI+30% p.a.
Share options
None of the directors held any share options granted under the Chemring 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme at 1 November 2008 and 31 October 2009.
