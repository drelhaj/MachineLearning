Directors' Remuneration Report
for the year ended 31 October 2011
This report sets out the information required by the Companies Act 2006, and Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The Report also satisfi es the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions relating to 
directors' remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Directors' Remuneration Report will be submitted to shareholders for 
approval at the Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2012.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on certain parts of the Directors' Remuneration Report 
and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting 
regulations. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for the audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee comprised:
 Mr I F R Much (Committee Chairman)
 Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss
 The Rt Hon Lord Freeman
 Mr P C F Hickson
Mr Hickson, the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, was considered to be independent on appointment.
Mrs V Murray was also appointed as a member of the Committee on her appointment as a non-executive director on 1 November 2011. 
The Committee's principal responsibilities are:
  determining, agreeing with the Board and reviewing from time to time the overall policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the 
executive directors, the Company Secretary, members of the Executive Committee and the fi rst tier of senior management below the 
Executive Committee, and their individual remuneration packages and any changes thereto;
  reviewing the market competitiveness of the remuneration policy and arrangements;
  overseeing salary levels and remuneration packages for the second and third tiers of management;
  approving the terms and conditions of employment, and any changes thereto, of the executive directors; 
  approving any compensation payments for executive directors;
  approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group;
  reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and the Company's shareholders; 
  providing oversight of potential remuneration-related risks arising across the Group; and
  overseeing any major changes in employee benefi ts structures across the Group.
With the exception of Mr Hickson, whose remuneration is determined by the Committee, none of the Committee members has 
any personal fi nancial interest in the matters reserved for the Committee nor do they have any confl icts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships, and they are not involved in the day to day running of the Group's business. Therefore, they are regarded by the 
Board as independent. Mr Hickson does not participate in any discussions regarding his own remuneration.
The Committee met six times during the year. The Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation but no executive director or other 
employee is present during discussions relating to their own remuneration.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company's website or on request from the Company Secretary.
Advisers
During the year, the Committee retained New Bridge Street (an Aon Hewitt company) to advise on remuneration and incentive-plan 
related matters. The Company received no other services from New Bridge Street, or any other part of the Aon group of companies, 
during the year. 
The Committee consults internally with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The Committee's policy is to provide executive remuneration packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by reference to market 
rates across comparator companies, which take into account the individual contribution and performance of each executive, and which 
refl ect the performance of the business against fi nancial objectives. Remuneration packages comprise the following elements:
(i) base salary and benefi ts, including pensions;
(ii) annual bonuses linked to the Group's fi nancial performance and personal objectives; and 
(iii) awards of share-based incentives linked to the long term growth of the Group.
The Committee aims to align the interests of executive directors and senior executive with those of shareholders, by ensuring that a 
signifi cant proportion of remuneration is performance-related. This is achieved through the performance-related elements of annual 
bonuses and share-based incentives. Corporate governance

There were a number of important infl uences on the Committee's key decisions during the year:
  The Group completed two major acquisitions, Mecar S.A. and Roke Manor Research Limited, towards the end of the 2010 fi nancial 
year, and in April 2011, the acquisition of the General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products' Detection Systems business (now 
Chemring Detection Systems, Inc.) was announced.
  The acquisition of Mecar has resulted in a signifi cant increase in the Group's sales to non-NATO countries, and Roke has substantially 
augmented the Group's engineering capabilities in electronics, software and systems engineering. The Chemring Detection Systems 
acquisition creates substantial opportunities to enhance the Group's existing IED detection capabilities.
  These three new businesses have increased the Group's revenue by over  149 million on an annualised basis and, as a result, the 
operational complexity of managing the Group has intensifi ed. These important factors were taken into account when the Committee 
adjusted salary levels for the executive directors with effect from 1 April 2011.
  Prospects within the defence sector were reasonably optimistic in the fi rst half of the year. This was refl ected in highly challenging 
earnings per share and cash fl ow targets set by the Committee for the annual bonus plan for the year ended 31 October 2011 and 
the equally demanding earnings per share targets set for the awards made under the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan in 
January 2011.
  However, the immediate outlook for the sector became increasingly uncertain towards the end of 2011. This has been an important 
infl uence on the Committee's thinking on a number of issues during the last few months, resulting in:
 - the imposition of a salary freeze for the executive directors for 2012;
 - the award of zero bonuses for the year ended 31 October 2011; and
 - reduced earnings per share growth targets for Performance Share Plan awards to be made during 2012.
Full details on the Committee's key decisions are set out below.
Comparator groups
The constituents of the sector-based comparator group utilised by the Committee for remuneration benchmarking purposes during the 
year were as follows:
Bodycote plc Melrose PLC Senior plc
Charter International plc Morgan Crucible Company  Spectris plc
Domino Printing Services plc QinetiQ Group PLC Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc
Fenner PLC Renishaw plc Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Halma plc Rotork PLC 
The Committee also considered a general comparator group of forty nine FTSE companies with a similar market capitalisation and turnover 
of half to double that of the Group.
Base salaries and benefi ts
The executive directors' base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if appropriate, taking into account 
individual performance and comparable salary levels in the comparator groups set out above. The Committee refers to published salary 
surveys and data provided by its remuneration advisers, New Bridge Street, and also reviews the remuneration information presented in 
the annual reports of companies in the comparator groups.
The Committee has considered two annual salary reviews since the last Directors' Remuneration Report was published:
  2011 adjustment (effective 1 April 2011): As explained above, a key consideration for the Committee when it carried out the salary review 
in early 2011 was the enhanced complexity of the most senior executive roles following the expansion of the Group. The Committee also 
took into account the outstanding and sustained Group performance over a number of years and the demand for talented executive 
management with a proven track record in the industry. The Group has a relatively small executive management team, and the current 
members of this team have been critical to the Group's recent success. The Committee was keen to ensure that these individuals were 
motivated to remain with the Group. Accordingly, salaries for the executive directors were increased by 9.4% with effect from 1 April 
2011. Revised salaries were, therefore, Dr Price  525,000 and Mr Rayner  328,125.
  2012 adjustment (effective 1 April 2012): In light of the increasingly diffi cult immediate trading outlook for the Group, given the current 
worldwide pressure on defence budgets, the Committee has determined that there should be no adjustment to the executive directors' 
salaries for 2012. The executive directors' salaries will, therefore, remain at the levels outlined above for 2012. 
Mrs Ellard's base salary was increased from  180,000 to  200,000 on her appointment as an executive director on 7 October 2011.
The executive directors' base salaries will next be reviewed on 1 April 2013.
The Committee also considers and approves the base salaries for twenty seven other senior executives, and reviews salaries for the next 
two tiers of management at each of the Group's businesses. In addition, the Committee receives information on general pay levels across 
the Group. The Committee therefore has due regard to salary levels across the Group in applying its remuneration policy.
The main taxable benefi ts for executive directors are fully-expensed company cars and private medical insurance.

Annual bonuses
During the year under review, the Company operated an annual performance-related bonus plan for the executive directors, with key 
characteristics as follows:
  a maximum bonus potential for the executive directors of 100% of base salary;
  three quarters of the bonus potential linked to two separate fi nancial performance conditions, namely earnings per share and cash fl ow 
(with equal weighting). The conditions, which are set by the Committee, take into account a number of factors including budget, market 
expectations, long term growth prospects and the previous year's out-turn. No bonus is payable for achievement of less than 90% of 
target, with bonuses being earned thereafter on a straight-line basis up to the maximum for 110% or better achievement of target;
  one quarter of the bonus potential may be achieved in connection with the satisfaction of personal objective criteria set at the 
beginning of the fi nancial year. These comprise a mixture of short term and longer term objectives linked to the delivery of the 
Company's strategic plan. No part of this element of bonus is payable unless threshold performance of both the fi nancial conditions 
described above is achieved. The personal objectives set for the executive directors during the year were linked to the following 
strategic objectives:
 - improvements in the Group's operational effi ciency
 - capture of key new programmes and delivery of new product development required for future organic growth
 - expansion of the Group's non-NATO activities
 - consolidation of previous acquisitions;
  40% of any bonus payable is deferred as a conditional award of the Company's shares, with vesting subject to continued employment 
(save in good leaver scenarios) three years from the award of bonus; and 
  the payment of any bonus remains ultimately at the discretion of the Committee.
Bonuses are non-pensionable.
The issues experienced by the Group right at the end of the fi nancial year, resulting in delays in revenue, meant that the tough pre-set 
targets on earnings per share and cash fl ow were missed and no bonus was payable in respect of these elements. Although many of the 
personal objectives were successfully achieved, nothing is payable under this element of the bonus plan unless threshold performance is 
achieved under both the earnings per share and cash fl ow measures. In summary, the Committee's belief in rigorous target setting meant 
that despite the Group achieving 5% year-on-year underlying earnings per share growth and successfully implementing a number of key 
strategic developments for the longer-term benefi t of the Group, no bonuses were payable to the executive directors for performance in 
the year under review.
The Committee has consistently set highly challenging bonus targets for the achievement of maximum bonuses. Despite the outstanding 
levels of earnings per share growth and returns to shareholders delivered by the Group in recent years, the executive directors did not 
receive maximum bonuses in any of the four years prior to the year under review, as evidenced by the chart below.

The basic structure of the bonus plan will remain unchanged for the current fi nancial year, namely with a maximum bonus potential of 
100% of base salary, with 40% of any bonus satisfi ed by the award of deferred shares. Clawback provisions exist in the bonus plan, which 
will enable the Company to clawback the deferred shares prior to vesting in the event of subsequent discovery of material misstatement 
of the Company's fi nancial results for the fi nancial year in respect of which the deferred shares were awarded. Bonuses will continue to be 
determined by a mixture of earnings per share, cash fl ow and personal objectives. Corporate governance

Performance share plan
The Company operates the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan for the executive directors and other key members of the senior 
management team who infl uence the performance and prospects of the Group. The key features of the plan are currently as follows:
  conditional awards can be made of the Company's shares worth no more than 150% of base salary each year under normal 
circumstances (200% of salary in exceptional circumstances);
  awards will vest three years after grant subject to the extent to which a demanding performance condition has been achieved over a 
single three year performance period (with no ability to re-test the performance condition). The performance condition is based on 
the growth of the Company's earnings per share in excess of RPI over three consecutive fi nancial years. The Committee considers an 
earnings per share condition to most closely align the interests of participants with those of the Company's shareholders;
  the vesting schedules for awards granted to date are as follows:
Awards to 
executive directors
Total earnings per share growth per annum (not compounded) over three fi nancial years
Threshold vesting Full vesting
Awards made prior to 
23 January 2007 100% of salary RPI +5% p.a. (33% vests) RPI+15% p.a.
Awards made on 
24 January 2007 100% of salary RPI +7.5% p.a. (33% vests) RPI+20% p.a.
Awards made on or after 
23 January 2008 100% of salary RPI +10% p.a. (25% vests) RPI+30% p.a.
Awards made on or after 
23 January 2010
125% of salary
RPI + 10% p.a. (25% vests for 
awards up to 100% of salary)
RPI + 25% p.a. (for any additional
awards over 100% of salary) 
RPI + 25% p.a. (for awards
up to 100% of salary)
RPI + 30% (for awards
up to 125% of salary)
Awards made on or after 
19 January 2011
150% of salary
RPI + 10% p.a. (25% vests for 
awards up to 100% of salary)
RPI + 25% p.a. (for any additional
awards over 100% of salary) 
RPI + 25% p.a. (for awards
up to 100% of salary)
RPI + 35% p.a. (for awards
up to 150% of salary)*
* For awards of up to 150% of base salary, 100% will vest at RPI + 25%, with the additional 50% vesting on a straight-line basis between RPI + 25% and RPI + 35%
  No shares vest for growth below the threshold vesting target. Vesting is calculated on a straight-line basis for growth between the 
threshold and full vesting targets;
  earnings per share is calculated on a fully diluted and normalised basis, as specifi ed by the Committee prior to grant; and
  market purchase shares or new issue shares (including treasury shares) may be used to satisfy awards. To the extent that new issue 
shares or treasury shares are used, these will count towards the usual share usage dilution limits (10% in ten years for all schemes and 
5% in ten years for discretionary (executive) schemes).
Participation in the plan is extended at the discretion of the Committee to the executive directors and senior management of the Group, 
both in the UK and overseas. The following awards were made under the plan during the year:
Date of award
Total number of 
shares awarded
Number of participants 
receiving awards
19 January 2011 693,720* 36
24 October 2011 17,492 1
Total 711,212 37
* Restated to refl ect subdivision of 5p ordinary shares into 1p ordinary shares
Details of the awards made to executive directors during the year are set out on page 46.
Clawback provisions apply to all awards under the plan from 2011 onwards, which will enable the Company to clawback awards prior to 
vesting in the event of subsequent discovery of material misstatement of the Company's fi nancial results, and after having fi rst clawed 
back any unvested deferred shares awarded as part of the annual bonus for the fi nancial year in which the results were misstated.
The Committee has historically set highly challenging earnings per share targets, refl ecting the Board's confi dence in the strong growth 
prospects for the Group but also the Committee's fi rm commitment to align the interests of shareholders with the executive management 
through the use of signifi cant levels of potential variable pay triggered by exceptional levels of performance.
In considering the performance condition for awards which will be made in 2012, the Committee has remained consistent with its 
commitment to tough target setting. However, with defence budgets around the world under signifi cant pressure, growth prospects for 
the Group are considerably more uncertain and this is refl ected in the lower target growth range selected by the Committee.  Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2011
43
Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information
The following vesting schedule will therefore apply for awards made in 2012:
Total earnings per share growth per annum 
(not compounded) over three fi nancial years Value of award that will vest
Less than 3% p.a. 0%
3% p.a. 15% of base salary
5% p.a. 25% of base salary
10% p.a. 100% of base salary
10% p.a. up to 12.5% p.a. 100% to 150% of base salary
Given the fl uctuating nature of infl ation over recent years, the Committee feels that it is more appropriate going forward to set a robust 
target that is expressed as a simple growth percentage (rather than a target expressed as RPI+x%). The Committee believes that this 
simpler structure will be more transparent for both shareholders and executives.
The Committee is satisfi ed that, although lower than for previous awards, this target range is still highly challenging given the current 
prospects for the Group and for the sector.
The Committee reviews, from time to time, the basis of the performance condition but continues to believe that the earnings per share 
metric mostly closely aligns the interests of executives and shareholders, and therefore remains an appropriate metric for the Group.
During the year under review, the Company purchased 300,000* (2010: 634,400*) treasury shares at a cost of  1.5 million for use in 
the plan. 456,855* shares were transferred from treasury to participants in the plan during the year on vesting of the awards made on 
23 January 2008.
The executive directors are expected to build-up, over a fi ve year period following appointment, and maintain a shareholding in the Company 
equivalent to one year's base salary. All of the executive directors currently hold shares in excess of this requirement. Other participants 
in the plan are expected to retain a shareholding equivalent to up to 50% of their base salary following vesting of the awards.
Other schemes
The Company operates all-employee savings-related share schemes in the UK (The Chemring Group 2008 Sharesave Plan) and the US 
(The Chemring Group 2008 US Stock Purchase Plan). There are no performance criteria for these arrangements, and options are issued 
to all participants in accordance with UK HM Revenue and Customs and US Internal Revenue Service regulations.
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines contained within the ABI Principles of Remuneration . At 31 October 2011, awards 
outstanding and issued under all share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 3.07% of the ordinary share capital of the 
Company. At 31 October 2011, awards outstanding and issued under executive share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 
2.67% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.

Pensions
The executive directors were members of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme (the Staff Scheme ) until 6 April 2010. This is an 
approved fi nal salary scheme, which is contracted out of the State Second Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up 
to two-thirds of salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits. The pension arrangements for the executive directors under the Staff Scheme 
(1/80ths accrual rate only as far as the notional earnings cap) were well below market norms. The Committee therefore agreed that with 
effect from 6 April 2010, the executive directors would cease to participate in the Staff Scheme, and would instead, for all future service, 
receive a salary supplement of 20% of base salary.
Service contracts
The executive directors all have rolling service contracts, as follows:
Date of 
commencement Notice period
S L Ellard 7 October 2011 12 months
D J Price 4 April 2005 12 months
P A Rayner 27 August 1999 12 months
The contracts may all be terminated by the Company without notice, by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of the salary 
due for the unexpired notice period plus the fair value of any contractual benefi ts. The contracts for Mrs Ellard and Dr Price provide that 
any such sum may be paid in instalments, and in these circumstances there is a requirement to mitigate loss. Mr Rayner's contract does 
not include such a provision.
It is the Committee's general policy that all new executive directors appointed in the future will have service contracts with the Company 
which are terminable on a maximum of twelve months' notice. The service contracts will contain provisions permitting the Company to 
make any termination payments by instalments, and will require directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
Policy on outside appointments
With the specifi c approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of 
other companies, provided that they do not detract from their responsibilities to the Group, and may retain any related fees paid to them. 
Mr Rayner and Mrs Ellard do not currently hold any such external appointments. Dr Price is currently serving as a non-executive director 
of AZ Electronic Materials S.A., for which he receives and retains an annual fee of  55,000.
Non-executive directors
Mr Hickson's letter of appointment provides for a three year appointment at a fi xed fee of  170,000 per annum. The appointment may 
be terminated on six months' notice by either party. It is anticipated that Mr Hickson will devote four to fi ve days each month to his role, 
subject to the overriding requirement that he allocates suffi cient time to the role as is reasonably necessary for the proper performance 
of his duties.
The other non-executive directors are all appointed for three year terms under letters of appointment covering, amongst other items, 
their terms of appointment and expected time commitment. The appointments may be terminated earlier by and at the discretion 
of either party upon three months' written notice. The Rt Hon Lord Freeman is currently serving his second three year term as a 
non-executive director, which will expire on 25 May 2012. Mr Evans' current appointment as a non-executive director will terminate on 
30 March 2012, and he has advised the Board that he intends to retire and will not therefore seek reappointment at the Annual General 
Meeting on 21 March 2012. Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss are currently serving their third terms, under letters of appointment 
which have been extended on a rolling basis. Mrs Murray's fi rst three year term will expire on 31 October 2014.
Following a review of time commitment and market rates, the basic fees for the non-executive directors were adjusted during the year. 
The basic fee payable to each of the fi ve non-executive directors is now  55,000 per annum. The Rt Hon Lord Freeman and Mr Much each 
receive an additional fee of  8,000 per annum, in respect of their Chairmanship of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee 
respectively. Mr Much also serves as the Senior Independent Director but he receives no additional fee for this role. Fees for the 
non-executive directors have been fi xed for the next three years.
The Company provides private medical insurance for Mr Evans, Mr Hickson and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, and their respective spouses.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's pension, bonus or share-based incentive schemes. However, Mr Evans does 
receive a pension from the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme, which he accrued during his former employment with the Company. Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2011
