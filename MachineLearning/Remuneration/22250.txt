 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee of the Board (RemCo ) is primarily responsible
for determining the remuneration policy and conditions of service for executive
Directors and the Chairman of the Company. It also reviews and monitors the
level and structure of remuneration for senior management immediately below
the level of the Board. The terms of reference of the RemCo can be found on the
Company' s website. 
The RemCo consists entirely of independent non-executive Directors and
has been chaired by Robert Walvis since November 2003. Its other members 
are Stephen Howard, Steven Marshall, Gordon Sage and Christoph von Rohr. 
Sir David John attends meetings by invitation. No member of the RemCo has
any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters 
to be decided by the RemCo, nor potential conflicts of interest arising from
cross-directorships, and no member of the RemCo has any day-to-day
involvement in the executive management of the Group. 
During 2007 the Chief Executive, Ian Tyler, was invited to join meetings 
of the RemCo when appropriate. Paul Raby, the human resources director, 
has acted as secretary of the RemCo during the year. No Director has any
involvement in discussions relating to his own remuneration.
The RemCo is responsible for appointing external independent 
consultants to advise on executive remuneration matters. This advice and
assistance has been provided to the RemCo throughout the year by New Bridge
Street Consultants LLP (NBSC ) and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC ). 
The human resources director has also provided advice to the RemCo. The terms
of reference of the independent consultants are available on the Company' s
website. During the year PwC also provided other tax and consultancy services
to the Company. The RemCo is satisfied that no conflict of interest arises from
the provision of this advice.
Executive Directors' remuneration
General policy
It is the policy of the RemCo to provide an overall remuneration package that is
competitive and which facilitates the recruitment and retention of high calibre
management. The annual and long-term incentive plans make up an important
part of each executive Director' s remuneration and are structured so as to
motivate senior managers to deliver high standards of performance, without
encouraging excessive risk taking. It is intended that the share-based elements
of the package will not only drive performance over the long term but will 
also assist in aligning the interests of senior management with those of
shareholders. 
The structure of executive Directors' remuneration was similar in 2007 
to that in 2006 and no significant changes to the existing policy are currently
envisaged for 2008. Under the current arrangements, if target performance 
is achieved, basic salary will represent around one-half of total earnings. 
If maximum is achieved, which would involve a superior level of performance
substantially in excess of business plan, basic salary will represent around 
one-third of total earnings.
Executive Directors are eligible to be members of the Balfour Beatty
Pension Fund and the general pensions policy is described below.
Basic salaries
It is the policy of the RemCo to set basic salaries at levels which it believes are
competitive given the size and complexity of the Company, as well as the broad
business sectors in which it operates. To assist in this, NBSC and PwC provide
data and independent advice on remuneration levels in companies considered
to be comparable in terms of annual sales, market capitalisation and industry
sector. The RemCo looks to set basic salaries at around the median of the
market, but also takes into account its own judgement of the performance of 
the Group' s businesses and the performance of individual Directors. The RemCo
intends to continue to use this approach in the foreseeable future.
The basic salaries of executive Directors are reviewed annually at 1 July
and the basic salaries following the review at 1 July 2007 are shown in the
table below. The average increase was 8.8%. 
                                                                                                                                                     Salary at

Annual incentive plan
Each executive Director participates in an annual incentive plan, under which
predetermined financial targets must be achieved before any payment is
earned. The maximum potential bonus which could have been earned by
executive Directors for 2007 was 80% of basic salary and the performance
indicator chosen was profit before tax and exceptional items (profit ). A bonus
of 40% of basic salary would have been earned for the achievement of
performance in line with target. Two-thirds of these bonuses are payable in
cash, while the remaining one-third is deferred in the form of ordinary shares 
in the Company under the Deferred Bonus Plan (the DBP ). These shares, 
along with shares awarded in lieu of dividends paid during the deferral period,
will be released to the Directors after three years, providing they are still
employed by the Company at that time (unless specified leaver conditions are
met in which case early vesting may be permitted under the rules of the DBP).
Bonuses are non-pensionable. The actual profit for the year ended 31 December
2007 resulted in a bonus of 80% of basic salary for each executive Director.
Details are shown in the table on page 19.
Shares awarded under the DBP in respect of the annual incentive plan are
shown in the table on page 21.
It is currently intended that the annual incentive plan for 2008 will operate
in the same way as for 2007 and the RemCo will continue to review the
competitiveness and structure of the annual incentive plan in future years.
Long-term incentive scheme
The RemCo believes that performance related long-term incentives which 
align executives with both business strategy and shareholders' interests 
are an important component of overall executive remuneration arrangements. 
The Company operates a Performance Share Plan (the Plan ) under which
conditional awards of shares in the Company are made to executive Directors
and other selected operational and functional senior managers. The maximum
market value of any award, at the award date, will be 150% of basic salary,
other than in exceptional circumstances, where the limit is 200% of basic
salary. It is currently the intention of the RemCo that an award of 150% of 
salary will only be made to the Chief Executive, with the other executive
Directors receiving conditional awards over shares with a market value of 
125% of basic salary.

The awards will vest, subject to the achievement of performance conditions,
three years after the date of grant. It is the intention of the RemCo to make
awards under the Plan in 2008 and that the performance conditions will follow 
a similar format to those which apply to the award made in 2007. For this 
award there are two performance conditions each applying to separate parts 
of the award. 
50% of an award is linked to an adjusted earnings per share (EPS )
growth target, and will vest as shown in the table below. The RemCo will
review these targets when setting the performance conditions for the 
2008 award to ensure they remain appropriately stretching given the 
business outlook.
EPS growth over three years                    Proportion of award vesting
Less than RPI + 15%                                 Zero
RPI + 15%                                                   25%
RPI + 45%                                                   100%
Between RPI + 15% and RPI + 45%        Between 25% and 100% pro-rata
Growth in EPS will be determined following independent verification of the
calculations made internally.
The performance condition attached to the other 50% of an award is
based on total shareholder return (TSR ) performance, measured against a
group of UK listed companies operating in comparable markets to the Company.
The companies used for the 2007 award were as follows: Aggreko, AMEC,
Atkins (WS), Babcock International, Capita, Carillion, Costain, Hanson,
Interserve, Keller, Kier, Alfred McAlpine, MITIE, Morgan Sindall, Serco, SIG,
Travis Perkins and Wolseley. It is currently anticipated that a similar peer group
will be used for the awards to be made in 2008.
The TSR performance of all companies will be measured over the three
year performance period, with the TSR of Balfour Beatty compared to the TSR of
the other companies. This part of an award will vest (in part) if Balfour Beatty' s
TSR is equivalent to the company whose TSR performance is at the median,
with full vesting if Balfour Beatty' s TSR is equivalent to, or above, that of the
company whose TSR performance is at the upper quartile. The precise scale of
vesting is shown in the table below:
Total shareholder return                           Proportion of award vesting
Below median                                            Zero
Median                                                       25%
Upper quartile                                            100%
Between median and upper quartile       Between 25% and 100% pro-rata
TSR will be independently calculated and verified by the RemCo. There is no
provision for the re-testing of these performance conditions.
The RemCo considers that the EPS and TSR performance conditions
provide a good blend of performance metrics, with EPS growth rewarding strong
financial performance and TSR rewarding stock market performance, providing
a strong and direct alignment with investors.
Pensions
The Company' s pension policy was reviewed in the light of the changes to the
taxation of pensions which were introduced in April 2006. The Company is not
compensating any member of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (the Fund ) 
(or any other pension scheme operated by the Company) for any additional tax
which is payable as a result of the new legislation. If members choose to opt
out of the Fund as a result of their benefits reaching or exceeding the Lifetime
Allowance, a cash supplement will be payable to them. A Fund specific earnings
cap has been maintained in the Fund for those members who were subject to 
the HMRC earnings cap and, in line with previous policy, a discretionary cash
supplement will be paid in lieu of pension provision above the Fund specific
earnings cap. 
Share ownership guidelines
To further align the interests of senior management with those of shareholders,
executive Directors and other key senior managers are subject to share
ownership guidelines. Executive Directors are required to build up a holding in
ordinary shares in the Company to the value of 100% of their basic salary at a
reference date. In order to achieve this, they will be expected to retain at least
half of the shares (after payment of any taxes due) which vest from awards made
under the Plan and the DBP . At 31 December 2007, each executive Director' s
shareholding in the Company exceeded this guideline.
Share options
No grants of options have been made under the Executive Share Option Scheme
2001 since 31 December 2004 and it remains the intention of the RemCo that 
no further grants will be made under this plan to any level of management,
other than in exceptional circumstances.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in a HMRC approved
savings-related share option scheme. 
Service contracts
It remains the Company' s policy and practice to include in executive Directors'
contracts a 12 months' rolling notice period from the Company and six months'
notice on the part of the Director. This policy will continue in the future. 
Details of the service contracts of the executive Directors are shown in the
table below.
                                                                                                                                                Notice period from

Service contracts of executive Directors do not include provision for specific
payment in the event of early termination, nor do they provide for extended
notice periods or compensation in the event of a change of control. It is not 
the RemCo' s intention to introduce such provisions. If any existing contract 
of employment is breached by the Company in the event of termination, the
Company would be liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating to 
the net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period.
The RemCo would seek to ensure that the Director fulfils his obligation to
mitigate his losses and would also give consideration to phased payments
where appropriate. External appointments
The RemCo recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive Directors
to take a non-executive role elsewhere. With approval of the Board in each
case, executive Directors may therefore accept one external appointment and
retain any related fees. Jim Cohen was appointed as a non-executive director 
of office2office plc on 29 June 2004 and fees of  4,711 were paid to him for 
his services from 1 January 2007 to his retirement from the Company on 
18 February 2007.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following
recommendations from the Nomination Committee. The Chairman' s
remuneration falls within the remit of the RemCo and the Board determines 
the terms on which the services of other non-executive Directors are provided.
All non-executive Directors are elected for a term of three years and must retire
and, if eligible, seek re-election at the AGM in the third calendar year following
the year in which they were elected (or last re-elected). They are not eligible to
join any pension scheme operated by the Company and cannot participate in
any of the Company' s share option, annual incentive or long-term incentive
schemes. None of the appointment letters for non-executive Directors contain
provision for specific payment in the event of termination for whatever cause. 
The dates of the letters of appointment or last election (or last re-election) of the
non-executive Directors are shown in the table below.
                                                                       Date of appointment                       Unexpired period at

The fees of the non-executive Directors are reviewed from time to time with the
last review having taken effect from 1 July 2006, when the Board increased
annual fees for the non-executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) to  42,000
and for the Chairman to  190,000. 
Additional fees of  7,000 per annum are payable to Robert Walvis and
Steven Marshall for their chairmanship of the RemCo and Audit Committees
respectively. A fee of u30,000 per annum is payable to Christoph von Rohr 
for his chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH
during 2007.

Performance graph
The graph below shows Balfour Beatty' s Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) performance compared to the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment companies) 
TSR over the five financial years ended 31 December 2007.
The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a  100 hypothetical holding of ordinary shares in Balfour
Beatty plc and in the index at the start of the period and have been calculated using 30 trading day average values.
As in previous reports, the RemCo has elected to compare the TSR on the Company' s ordinary shares against the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment
companies) principally because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member.  Directors' remuneration earned in 2007

Notes:
(i)    All awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc.
(ii)   For the awards made in April 2005, the performance period is the three years ended 31 December 2007. The maximum award of shares shown in the table
above will vest only if earnings per share before exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets (EPS ) grows by at least 70% over the performance
period. If EPS growth is 25%, the Directors will be entitled to 30% of the maximum award of shares. If EPS growth is between 25% and 70%, the number of
shares vesting will be pro-rata to actual growth. No shares will vest if EPS growth is less than 25%, and there is no provision for re-testing.
(iii)  For the awards made in June 2006 and April 2007, the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009
respectively. 50% of each award is subject to an EPS growth target. The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if EPS
growth exceeds the retail prices index (RPI ) by 45% over the performance period. If EPS growth exceeds RPI by 15% then 25% of this part of the award will
vest. For growth in EPS between these points, vesting will be on a pro-rata basis. No shares will vest from this part of the award if EPS growth exceeds RPI by
less than 15%. The other 50% of each award is subject to a total shareholder return (TSR ) target under which the TSR of the Company is compared to that
of a comparator group of 18 companies listed in the UK, at the start of the performance period. The maximum number of shares subject to this performance
condition will only vest if the Company' s TSR is at the upper quartile of the comparator group. If the Company' s TSR is equal to that of the median of the
comparator group then 25% of this part of the award will vest. No shares from this part of the award will vest if the Company' s TSR is below that of the
median of the comparator group. For TSR performance between median and upper quartile, vesting will be on a pro-rata basis. There is no provision for 
re-testing of either of the performance conditions. 
(iv)  The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the award dates which was used for calculating the
number of awards granted, was 260.417p for the 2004 award, 305.417p for the 2005 award, 308.417p for the 2006 award and 491.583p for the 2007 award.
The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the date of the awards was 260p, 290p, 301.25p and 490.75p respectively.
(v)   Jim Cohen retired from the Company on 18 February 2007. At this time a proportion of his 2005 award lapsed reflecting the proportion of the performance
period for this award which had not been completed at the date of retirement. The remainder of this award will vest in the same proportion, and at the same
time, as the awards made to other participants in 2005.
(vi)  The performance period for the awards made in April 2005 was completed on 31 December 2007. The growth in EPS for this period was 58.37% and as a
result, 81.91% of each participant' s conditional award will vest on 18 April 2008. 
(vii) The performance period for the awards made in April 2004 was completed on 31 December 2006. The growth in EPS for this period was 40.33% and as 
a result, 53.85% of each participant' s conditional award vested on 19 April 2007. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the vesting date 
was 476p.

Directors' report and accounts 2007  Directors' pensions
Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (the Fund ). The scheme provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 (under the Fund' s
rules) and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable salary. The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years' pensionable
service at normal retirement age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to HMRC limits. With effect from 6 April 2006, HMRC limits were
changed, and as a result the HMRC earnings cap is no longer in force. However, a Fund-specific earnings cap has been retained in the Fund. The salaries of Jim
Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Fund earnings cap for pension purposes. Details of the taxable cash supplements paid to them by the
Company, in lieu of pension provision above the Fund earnings cap are shown in the table on page 19. Directors may be paying additional voluntary contributions,
but neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the tables below. 
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the scheme at normal retirement age based on each executive
Director' s service to 31 December 2007 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.

Notes:
(i)    The transfer value of the increase in accrued deferred pension is the present value of the increase in excess of inflation in the deferred pension and associated
benefits during the period, less the Director' s contributions, calculated using the transfer basis in force at 31 December 2007 and on the basis of actuarial
advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. 
(ii)   Anthony Rabin' s pensionable service includes nine years of transferred-in service from previous pensions arrangements.
(iii)  Jim Cohen retired from the Company on 18 February 2007 and started to draw his pension from 6 April 2007. The year end figure shown above is the annual
pension receivable from 6 April 2007. The figure shown at 31 December 2006 is the pension Mr Cohen would have received had he drawn his pension from
that date.
The table below sets out the transfer value at 31 December 2007 of each executive Director' s accrued deferred pension at that date as well as the movement in
that transfer value over the period. The transfer values represent the cash equivalent values that would have been payable from the scheme had the Directors left
service on the dates shown, and reflect the age of the Director, his period of membership of the scheme and his pensionable salary.

Notes:
(i)    The transfer value is the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benefits at the relevant date, calculated using the transfer basis then in
force and on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(ii)   The figure is the difference between the transfer value of the accrued benefits at the start and end of the period, less the Director' s contributions during 
the period.
(iii)  Jim Cohen retired on 18 February 2007. Despite the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year, the transfer value has decreased
during the year ended 31 December 2007 reflecting the shorter expected payment period and changing market conditions which reduce the transfer value of
the pension benefits.
No past Director of the Company has received or become entitled to receive retirement benefits in excess of his entitlements on the date on which those benefits
first became payable, or 31 March 1997 if later.
