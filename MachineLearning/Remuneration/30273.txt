Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and
meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. The Committee
recognises that a new Combined Code on Corporate Governance was published in July 2003. Although the
new Combined Code does not apply to the report for this financial year ended 31 December 2003, the
Committee has reviewed its policies and procedures to assess the extent of compliance with the new
Combined Code and this report, in part, reflects that review. The Committee will report fully on compliance
with the new Combined Code in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ending 31 December 2004.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2004 inviting
them to consider and approve this report.
The auditors are required to report to the Company's members on that part of this remuneration report which
is subject to audit and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
This report is therefore presented in two sections: unaudited information and audited information.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up solely of non-executive directors with no personal financial interest
other than as shareholders in the matters to be decided. The non-executive directors serving on the
Remuneration Committee, throughout the financial year, were Sir Nigel Mobbs (Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee), Mr Tim Melville-Ross and Mr Mark Nicholls. On being appointed to the Board on
4 July 2003 as a non-executive director, Mrs Lesley MacDonagh became a member of the Remuneration
Committee. Sir Nigel Mobbs takes no part in any discussions or decisions pertaining to his own remuneration
or terms of employment. Meetings of the Remuneration Committee are held as and when appropriate and at
least annually. During 2003, the Remuneration Committee met on three occasions and each meeting was
attended by all the members, then current, of the Remuneration Committee.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, from time to time, calls upon Mr Malcolm Harris (Chief Executive) to assist in
discussions and deliberations of the Remuneration Committee on remuneration matters not pertaining to the
remuneration or terms and conditions of his own employment. The Remuneration Committee has, on occasion,
appointed external advisers including Ernst & Young, in February 2003, to advise on director remuneration.
Ernst & Young does not provide any other services to the Group. Towers Perrin act as Trustee for the Bovis
Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan. The Group Company Secretary, Mr Martin Palmer, acts as Secretary to
the Remuneration Committee.
Duties of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the following duties:
a) Determine on behalf of the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman,
the Chief Executive, the executive directors and, as appropriate, other designated senior executives.
b) Ensure that executive directors and senior management are provided with appropriate incentives to
encourage enhanced performance and are rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of
the Company.
c) Determine targets for any performance related pay schemes and ask the Board to seek shareholder
approval for any long term incentive arrangements.
d) Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance criteria of all share based
remuneration schemes.
e) Ensure that contractual terms on termination and any payments made avoid rewarding poor performance
and approve any severance payments.
f) Determine the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman, Chief Executive, each executive
director and other designated senior executives, including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive
payments and share options.
Report on directors' remuneration Page 54 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomesgroup.plc.uk
g) Determine the policy for and scope of service agreements for executive directors and pensions
arrangements, termination payments and compensation commitments.
h) Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance conditions of the annual
bonus scheme and approve annual bonuses.
i) In determining remuneration packages and arrangements, give due regard to the requirements and
recommendations of the Combined Code as well as the UK Listings Authority's Listings Rules and
associated guidance.
j) Review competitor companies but ensure that automatic increases are not implemented.
k) Oversee any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company.
l) Ensure that the provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration, including pensions, as set out in the
Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, are fulfilled and produce an annual report of the
Committee's remuneration policy to be included in the Company's Annual Report and Accounts.
During late 2003 the terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee were reviewed and amended to take
account of the new Combined Code. These terms of reference are available on the Group's website
www.bovishomesgroup.plc.uk and on request to the Group Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company's policy for the remuneration of executive directors,
having regard to the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (Schedule 7A of the Companies Act
1985) and the Combined Code and its provisions on directors' remuneration (Schedules A and B) appended to
the UKLA Listing Rules.
The Remuneration Committee settles and implements the remuneration policy for executive directors and
designated senior management. The Remuneration Committee determines the need for independent
professional advice where appropriate and has regard to information on compensation and salary levels in
companies in the housebuilding sector and in other companies of comparable size, for executives with similar
skills, qualifications and experience. The objectives of the remuneration policy are to:
  ensure that the individual rewards and incentives fairly relate to the performance of the individual, the
Company and the interests of shareholders;
  maintain a remuneration package which enables the Company to attract, retain, and motivate executives
of the appropriate calibre and experience to further the success of the Company and maximise long term
shareholder value; and 
  take into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Remuneration package
The remuneration package consists of basic salary, performance bonus, health insurance, membership of the
Bovis Homes Regulated Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS), pension, participation in the Bovis
Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme, the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan, and the Bovis
Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee aims to balance appropriately those elements of a director's remuneration
which are subject to explicit performance conditions, accepting that all remuneration is linked with ongoing
appraisal of individual performance. By virtue of the various elements of directors' remuneration subject to
performance conditions, a significant part is variable and is not guaranteed. For remuneration paid during
2003 the fixed and variable element of the remuneration package for each director was as follows:

Salary
Executive director salaries are reviewed annually on 1 July taking into account the total remuneration package
at the time of the review.
External directorships
Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of
suitable companies and organisations outside the Group. Earnings arising from such external directorships are
payable directly to the Company.
Performance bonus
Following consultation with external advisers to the Remuneration Committee, Ernst & Young, the level of
performance bonus which executive directors are able to earn was reviewed in July 2003. Up until this date
the bonus entitlements were capped at a maximum of 50% of basic salary (60% for the Chief Executive). On
4 July 2003, based on the information arising from the Ernst & Young review of executive director benefits,
the Remuneration Committee resolved that the bonus entitlements be increased and capped at a maximum
of 100% of basic salary for each executive director. It was considered that in doing so the performance
bonuses aligned more with the performance bonus entitlements of other companies in the housebuilding
sector as well as other publicly listed companies of a similar size to the Company.
The bonuses payable to executive directors have been determined by the Remuneration Committee by
reference to challenging performance criteria including exceeding the previous year's profit before taxation
by a specified percentage and the achievement of other strategic targets. They include entitlement to benefit
under the new Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan amounting, for 2003, to a total of  9,000 (2002:
 9,255).
The bonuses of the executive directors are paid from a bonus pool which is generated from increases in profits
over the previous year. All employees share in this bonus pool. The Group profits before taxation and bonus
are required to grow year on year by 2% above the increase in the Retail Price Index ( RPI') before any bonus
becomes payable. Thereafter, for every 1% increase in profits before taxation and bonus one half of the
increase is available to be paid as bonus to all employees, subject to individual bonus caps. This applies until
the increase in profits before taxation and bonus reaches 12% over the increase in RPI at which point the
bonus pool is capped.
Additional performance criteria have been established by the Remuneration Committee determining when
bonuses equal to 100% of basic salary may be considered for payment. These include:
  achievement of an increase in Group profits before taxation and bonus of 12% over and above the increase
in RPI;
  achievement of the Group's budgeted pre tax profit for the year;
  achievement of Return on Average Capital Employed in excess of 20% for the year.
Pension
All the executive directors are senior executive members of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme. This is a defined
benefit scheme with contributions from both employer and employee, and approved by the Inland Revenue.
Pensionable earnings are basic pay. As a result of joining the Group after the implementation of the 1989
earnings cap rules, Mr David Ritchie and Mr Stephen Brazier are subject to the statutory earnings cap. Mr
Malcolm Harris is not subject to the earnings cap. Normal retirement age for senior executive members under
the scheme is 60, and the accrual rate is 1/45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service as a
senior executive.
Share schemes
The Company employs a standard set of performance conditions for all executive directors in respect of the
Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme and the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
These performance conditions are described under specific headings in this report. Granting of share options
and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The
performance conditions are designed to challenge and motivate executive directors in the direction of
improved profitability and enhanced shareholder return. The conditions are designed to require strong
collective and individual performance from the executive directors before options and awards vest, whilst at
the same time offering a credible opportunity for success. Page 56 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomesgroup.plc.uk
For share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to vest an independent view provided by
the Company's auditors, as independent experts, is required certifying achievement of the relevant
performance conditions. This independent view is evidenced by the completion of formal certificates signed
by the auditors. The performance conditions attaching to share options and awards under the Long Term
Incentive Plan are selected intentionally to be derived from readily available information which is
straightforward and transparent. This ensures that the auditors can make objective assessments of
achievement against the performance conditions.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme is
no longer consistent with current market practice. Therefore, if shareholders approve an amendment to the
rules of the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan, no future grants will be made under the Bovis
Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme. Subject to shareholder approval, the Remuneration
Committee intends to increase the maximum number of shares which may be awarded in any financial year
under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan from 75% of a participant's basic salary to 100%.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997. It is an Inland Revenue
approved scheme and grants options on an approved basis within Inland Revenue limits and on an unapproved
basis outside Inland Revenue limits. The scheme is operated by the Remuneration Committee and participants
are selected at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
On the grant of an option, the Board shall determine the performance conditions which must be satisfied as
a condition of exercise. The performance condition operated to date is that share options held under the Bovis
Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme can be exercised if the auditors have certified that the
cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in RPI by at least 4%
per annum (2% per annum for share options granted before 2001) over three consecutive years.
The exercise price of a share option is determined by the Board at the date of grant and will not be less than
the higher of the market value and nominal value of an Ordinary Share in the Company at the date of grant.
Each year, executive directors can be granted share options up to a maximum value equal to one year's basic
salary at the date of grant.
Assuming the performance condition is satisfied, share options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised
between the third and tenth anniversary from the date of grant.
Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan
A Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the
2000 Annual General Meeting and established on 10 May 2000. Under the rules of the scheme at the date of
this report a participant may receive in respect of any year a maximum award of shares with a market value,
when the award was made, not exceeding 75% of basic salary. Each award is made subject to the achievement
of certain performance conditions and awards may only be exercised at the end of three years. There is no cost
to the participants in the scheme to exercise the awards.
The Remuneration Committee has recommended to the Board that the rules in respect of the Long Term
Incentive Plan be amended to increase the maximum award from 75% to 100% of basic salary. This change
has been recommended on the basis that no further grants of share options will be made to the executive
directors and senior management. The Board has included an ordinary resolution in the Notice of meeting in
respect of this change in the rules to be voted upon at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2004.
The extent to which the awards may be exercised is determined by two measures of performance; total
shareholder return ( TSR') and earnings per share ( EPS') growth, each measured over a three year performance
period and each relating to half of the shares awarded.
The TSR measure requires the comparison of the growth in the Company's TSR over a three year period to that
of a group of comparator companies in the housebuilding industry specified by the Remuneration Committee
at the start of the performance period. TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid during
the three year period (assuming that such dividends are reinvested in ordinary shares). The Company's ranking
amongst the comparator companies will determine the percentage of the shares under the award which will
vest, as follows:
Report on directors' remuneration continued Bovis Homes Group PLC   Page 57
TSR ranking % of total award which can be realised
1st position 50% of the shares in the award
2nd position 45% of the shares in the award
3rd position 37.5% of the shares in the award
4th position 30% of the shares in the award
5th position 20% of the shares in the award
6th position 15% of the shares in the award
The group of comparator companies is as follows:
Comparator companies
Barratt Developments PLC Bellway p.l.c. The Berkeley Group plc Crest Nicholson PLC
Persimmon plc Redrow Group plc Westbury plc Wilson Bowden plc
Wilson Connolly Plc George Wimpey PLC
Following the acquisition of Wilson Connolly Plc by Taylor Woodrow plc, the comparator group applying to
any Long Term Incentive Plan awards in the future will include Taylor Woodrow plc in place of Wilson Connolly
Plc.
The EPS growth measure is based on the extent to which the Company's average annual EPS growth over the
three year performance period falls between minimum and maximum EPS growth targets set by the
Remuneration Committee as follows:
EPS growth % of total award which can be realised
Maximum EPS growth 50% of the shares in the award
Minimum EPS growth 20% of the shares in the award
For the current outstanding awards, the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets are 4% and 10% above
RPI respectively. Where EPS growth falls between the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets, the number
of shares which can be realised will be determined on a straight line sliding scale. Where EPS growth falls
below 4% above RPI, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS growth can be realised.
The shares required to satisfy the awards have been purchased by the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust. The
grant price of the awards is set as the market value of the shares at the date the shares are purchased by the
Trustee. The cost of these shares is amortised through the profit and loss account over the three year
performance period. The market value of the shares attributable to each director will be included in
remuneration in the year in which the awards are exercised. An award may only be exercised within six months
of the realisation date, the realisation date being the date of notification from the Trustee of the Bovis Homes
Group Employee Trust that the award is realisable in whole or in part.
Changes to the remuneration package
Prior to any payment of performance bonus or award under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan
during 2004 the Remuneration Committee has entered into a process of consultation with the Company's
major shareholders. This process of consultation has involved enquiring of these shareholders their view of the
increase in maximum award under the Bovis Homes Goup Long Term Incentive Plan in place of an annual
entitlement to share options under the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme. Further,
confirmation has been sought that performance bonus entitlements capped at a maximum of 100% of basic
salary are acceptable given comparable bonus schemes in similar companies. The Remuneration Committee
has been pleased with the general support received from those shareholders consulted. The Remuneration
Committee has included in the Notice of meeting for the 2004 Annual General Meeting an ordinary resolution
in respect of the change in entitlement to awards under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan. The
Remuneration Committee, having approved the grant of share options in March 2003, has deemed it
appropriate to not consider any further grants of share options to executive directors until shareholders have
an opportunity to vote on the ordinary resolution mentioned above.
Report on directors' remuneration continued Page 58 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomesgroup.plc.uk
Performance graph
As required by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the following table includes a
performance graph comparing, over the last five financial years, the total shareholder return of an ordinary
share held in Bovis Homes Group PLC against the total shareholder return of the FTSE Construction and
Building Materials index. This comparable index is appropriate given that the Remuneration Committee has
considered an appropriate comparator group of companies for benchmarking performance. This comparator
group is currently made up of ten UK listed housebuilders, all of which are included in the FTSE Construction
and Building Materials index. The ordinary shares of Bovis Homes Group PLC are included within the FTSE
Building Materials and Construction Index. As such, the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Index is
considered by the Remuneration Committee to be a representative comparator for total shareholder 
return performance.
Service agreements and terms of appointment
The executive directors entered into new service agreements on 1 July 2002 reflecting amended terms and
conditions resulting from an update of the Bovis Homes Staff Handbook. In respect of each of the executive
directors, the service agreements are rolling twelve month contracts with a twelve month notice period due
from either employer or employee.
In addition to their salaries, the executive directors are entitled to participate in the Bovis Homes' employee
share schemes including the Long Term Incentive Plan, and to be considered for a performance bonus,
dependent on the achievement of targets set down annually by the Remuneration Committee. They are also
entitled to membership of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme as a senior executive, and between 24 and 27
working days holiday per annum determined by length of service. The directors hold membership of the Bovis
Homes Regulated Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS). There are no specific provisions for
compensation on early termination.
The non-executive directors have entered into service agreements for their services which are established for
periods up to three years duration based upon the frequency of re-election to the Board with notice periods,
from either employer or employee, up to twelve months. Current agreements expire on the following dates:
Sir Nigel Mobbs - 30 June 2005; Mr Tim Melville-Ross - 30 June 2004; Mr Mark Nicholls - 30 June 2006; and
Mrs Lesley MacDonagh - 3 July 2006. The fees for their services were last reviewed with effect from 1 July
2003. In addition to his director's fee the Chairman Sir Nigel Mobbs will continue to use his existing office and
secretarial support at Slough Estates plc, and that company will be paid a fee of  15,000 per annum for these
services. There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination.

Changes in the number of ordinary shares held arose from the exercise of share options, the vesting and
exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards and the investment during the year in partnership shares through
the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan. Other changes in the number of ordinary shares held arose on 7
April 2003 with the allocation of free shares under the Share Incentive Plan. There were no changes in the
holdings of ordinary shares of any of the directors between 31 December 2003 and 5 March 2004, other than
the normal monthly investment in partnership shares through the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan. 
The directors' interests in share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on pages
62 and 63. There were no changes in the above holdings of share options and awards under the Long Term
Incentive Plan between 31 December 2003 and 5 March 2004.
Share ownership guidelines
There exist guidelines for executive directors in respect of share ownership of Bovis Homes' shares. The Board
expects executive directors benefiting from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of
executive share options to retain at least 50% of the net value derived from the exercise, after settling all costs
and income tax due, as shares. This guideline is expected to be applied until such time as the executive director
holds shares with a market value equal to current basic annual salary.

and loss account. These charges amounted to  537,817 during 2003 and took into account charges for senior
managers. Included within this amortisation charge was a charge of  298,400 in respect of the executive
directors who held office at 31 December 2003.
