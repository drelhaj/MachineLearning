Background
This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, (the regulation ). The auditors are 
required to report on the  auditable' part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the regulations). The report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and 
unaudited information.
The Board has reviewed the Group's compliance with the Combined Code 2006 (the Code ) on remuneration related matters. It is the opinion of  
the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.

** Mrs Victoria Mitchell stepped down as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on becoming Chairman of the Company on 1 August 2007.
The Remuneration Committee of the Board, except the Non-executive Chairman of the Company Mrs Victoria Mitchell, are all Non-executive 
Directors and independent. The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters 
to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role described. A copy of the terms 
of reference can be downloaded from the Company's website. 
The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year and continues to be advised by Halliwell Consulting, an independent executive 
compensation and share plan consultancy. No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
In determining the Executive Directors' remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the Group Managing Director, 
Mr A W Pidgley and the Group Finance Director, Mr R C Perrins. No Director played a part in any discussion about his or her remuneration.
Remuneration Policy Overview
The objective of the remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives. The Remuneration Committee believes 
that shareholders' interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on performance-related pay. Emphasis on 
performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy. It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that 
the policy provides meaningful incentives to Executives and ensures that the appropriate balance between fixed and performance related 
compensation is maintained. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews on an annual basis whether its remuneration policy remains appropriate for the relevant financial year. 
Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include:
  market conditions affecting the Company;
  the recruitment market in the Company's sector;
  changing market practice; and
  changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies. 
The Company's current long-term incentive for the Executive Directors is provided through The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (see later in the report for full details). This Plan provided for one grant on its adoption with the release of awards subject to the 
return to shareholders of  12 per share by 31 January 2011. Therefore the performance criteria and release schedules were fixed on the date of 
grant. However, the Committee does formally review the operation of the Plan on a regular basis to ensure it remains appropriate to the Company's 
current circumstances and prospects. 
At the beginning of the 2007/08 financial year the Committee reviewed the operation of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (the 2004(b) LTIP ) and determined to make the amendments set out on page 37 which were approved by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company on 5 September 2007.

New Remuneration Policy
The Board has recently reviewed the Company's strategy and has determined that it is appropriate to revise the strategy to take into account the 
strength of the Company and the current opportunities in the market. Full details of the proposed revisions are set out in the Chairman's Statement 
on pages 2 to 4. As a consequence the Remuneration Committee is proposing to adjust the Company's remuneration policy to ensure that it is 
aligned with the strategy and put these adjustments to shareholders for approval at the 2008 AGM. Full details of the proposed changes to the 
Company's remuneration are set out in the Notice of Meeting for the AGM; therefore this report focuses on the policy operated in 2007/08.
Policy for 2007/08
The 2007/08 financial year started on 1 May 2007 and finished on 30 April 2008.
The policy is to set the main elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration package against the following quartiles in the Company's 
comparator group:
Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in kind Share incentives
Upper decile Upper decile Lower quartile to median Market practice Upper decile
For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration, the Remuneration Committee used the following comparator group of companies in the year 
ended 30 April 2008:
Company name
Amec Plc Bellway Plc Marshalls Plc Taylor Wimpey Plc
Balfour Beatty Plc Bovis Homes Group Plc Persimmon Plc Travis Perkins Plc
Barratt Developments Plc Carillion Plc Redrow Plc
It is the intention of the Remuneration Committee to use the same basis for the comparator group for the year ending 30 April 2009 with the 
following adjustments to its constituents resulting from corporate activity during the year:-
  George Wimpey Plc was merged with Taylor Woodrow Plc to form Taylor Wimpey Plc;
  McAlpine (Alfred) Plc was acquired by Carillion Plc and is therefore excluded on an ongoing basis.
Balance between Fixed and Variable Performance-based Pay
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance-based pay for each Executive Director for the year ended 
30 April 2008:-
The Executive Directors hold no external appointments.

Elements of Executive Directors' Remuneration
Basic Salary
Policy: Upper decile 
Policy
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that the salaries of the Executive Directors should be set at the upper decile in line with the 
Committee's view that the Company has one of the most experienced Executive teams within the sector. When determining the salaries of the 
Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration:
  the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and 
complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group;
  the performance of the individual Executive Director; 
  the individual Executive Director's experience and responsibilities; and
  the pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Year ended 30 April 2008 and year ending 30 April 2009
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in May 2007 and 2008. The Committee felt that:-
  taking into account the above criteria; 
  the exceptional absolute and comparative performance of the Company during this challenging period; and
 the fact that with the exception of the Finance Director, the Executive Directors of the Company have not had a rise in salaries since May 2003;  
salary rises were appropriate.
In May 2007, increases of between 5% and 7.5% were awarded in respect of the year ended 30 April 2008, however, at that time the Executive 
Directors believed that the current balance of the remuneration package was appropriate and the salary recommendations were therefore not 
implemented in the year. 
In May 2008, further increases of between 6.25% and 9.75% were awarded in respect of the year ending 30 April 2009, however, in this case the 
Executive Directors decided, given the prevailing market conditions, not to take the increases in the current financial year.
Therefore, the Executive Directors have not taken cumulative increases of between 11.5% and 18% in respect of these two years.

Annual performance-related bonus
Policy: Upper decile bonus potential
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to set the maximum annual bonus potential at the upper decile in relation to the comparator group. 
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
General
The theoretical maximum bonus available is 300% of salary. However, the Remuneration Committee will only in very exceptional circumstances, 
outside the normal operation of the bonus plan for the year in question, consider a bonus payment greater than 200% of salary. On the occurrence 
of very exceptional circumstances and prior to any commitment to make a bonus payment, the Remuneration Committee would consult 
shareholders to obtain their agreement that the circumstances gave rise to the level of bonus payment proposed. Therefore the effective maximum 
annual bonus potential is 200% of salary.
Bonus targets are reviewed each year and agreed by the Remuneration Committee. The performance measures for the Executive Directors' 
bonus plan are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the 
Company, so that they continue to remain challenging. 
The structure of bonus payments is as follows:
Position Percentage cash Percentage Shares
Executive Bonus will be paid in cash up to a  Any bonus payment above 100% of salary  
 maximum of 100% of salary. will be invested, net of tax, in shares. These  
  shares will be retained by the Executives for 
  eighteen months.

Bonus Performance Criteria
Cash redemption condition 
This performance condition applies to 100% of the maximum bonus potential for the Group Executive Directors and 25% of the maximum bonus 
potential for the divisional Executive Directors. 
For the financial year ending 30 April 2009, the cash redemption condition requires the return of capital of  2 per Unit.
For the year ended 30 April 2008, the cash redemption condition will be met if the dividend lock up tests
(1)
 are satisfied at the end of the relevant 
financial year (six months earlier than required). If these tests are satisfied it means that the Company is on target to be able to make the 
redemption payments on the due dates. If the dividend lock up tests are not achieved at the end of the relevant financial year but the Board is of the 
view that they will be satisfied in time to make the next redemption payment on the relevant date, this element of the bonus will be accrued and not 
declared until the redemption payment has been made. In the highly unlikely event that a bonus is paid but the due redemption payment is not made 
the share element of the bonus paid shall be forfeited and the cash element paid shall be offset against future bonus entitlements.
In fact the Company actually made the scheduled 30 April 2009 redemption on 4 January 2008, one year ahead of the schedule for B share 
redemptions. Therefore as 2007/08 saw the early redemption of the 2009 B share, the Remuneration Committee has agreed the bonus payments 
set out above in respect of the year ended 30 April 2008.
Divisional PBT performance condition
The divisional PBT targets are set at the beginning of the financial year at a level which is challenging taking into account the potential level of bonus 
payments, the market, development availability and other relevant issues. The Remuneration Committee confirms that the annual bonus payments 
set out within this report for the divisional Executive Directors are appropriate taking into account the level of profit achieved and the targets set 
at the beginning of the year ended 30 April 2008. 
Share Incentives
Policy: Upper decile
Executive Directors
The only Executive share incentive plan operated by the Company is The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) Long-Term Incentive Plan approved 
by shareholders at the AGM on 17 September 2004. 
The Executive Directors in accordance with the rules of the 2004(b) LTIP were granted one award on the adoption of the Plan. Therefore, 
no awards have been granted to the Executive Directors during the financial year ended 30 April 2008 under the 2004(b) LTIP or any other share 
based arrangement.
(1)  The dividend lock up tests are the additional financial ratio tests set out in the Group's banking facilities that must be satisfied for the Company to make a redemption payment. These tests are more 
stringent than the ongoing financial covenant tests applicable to the Company's bank facilities.
Governance r emuneration c ommittee report 36 Other Senior Employees of the Company
The Company's business is broken down into a number of operating divisions. The Remuneration Committee in conjunction with the Board has, 
therefore, implemented both annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for other senior employees of the Company linked 
to the performance of the relevant division for which they work. Some elements of the cash bonus plans are annual other elements are deferred to 
ensure long-term consistent delivery by each division. The Remuneration Committee, in line with best practice, continually reviews with the Board 
the policy behind the compensation plans at this level in the Company to ensure they remain appropriate to the market and the Company's current 
circumstances. It is the view of both the Committee and the Board as a whole that these arrangements are very effective at ensuring the delivery 
of divisional performance for which these senior employees are responsible. Both the Remuneration Committee and the Board believe that having 
senior employees focused on the delivery of divisional results is an excellent way of driving shareholder value.
2004(b) LTIP Main Features
The Plan provides Executive Directors with rights to receive, at no cost, the shares set out in the table below. The number of shares awarded under 
the Plan was determined on 26 October 2004, the date of the Scheme of Arrangement, as 15% of the fully diluted share capital of the Company on 
adoption of the 2004(b) LTIP. The shares will only be released to the Executive Directors if the Company has returned to shareholders  12 per share 
by 31 January 2011 i.e. the end of the holding period. 50% of the shares subject to awards will be retained by the Executive Directors for a period of 
at least 12 months after the date of release, with the balance retained for a period of at least 24 months following release.
The following table sets out the awards made under the 2004(b) LTIP to the Executive Directors:-
Name Ordinary Shares 
A W Pidgley 11,371,393
R C Perrins 4,264,272
A Carey 3,553,560
G J Fry 2,132,136
The Remuneration Committee's policy is designed to incentivise the Executive Directors to maximise the total return to shareholders. In the 
Remuneration Committee's opinion this will be achieved by incentivising the Executive Directors to not only ensure that  12 per share is returned 
to shareholders but also by providing them with a direct share in the residual value of the Company. As a result, the value of the awards is directly 
linked to the value of the residual Company following the return and as such there is a close alignment between the interests of the Executive 
Directors and shareholders, both of whom benefit from a maximum value for the residual part of the Company. The Remuneration Committee will 
determine whether the performance condition has been satisfied by ensuring the redemption payments have been made in the allotted time frame.
Amendments to 2004(b) LTIP
Awards granted under the 2004(b) LTIP are released on the expiry of a holding period  subject to satisfaction of the performance requirements 
(being the Company returning  12 per Ordinary Shares by 31 January 2011). The holding period applicable to existing awards expires on 30 January 
2011. The Company amended the Articles of Association to facilitate the Company returning  12 per share earlier than 31 January 2011, therefore 
the terms of the 2004(b) LTIP were amended to enable the release of awards to occur on the earlier of:-
(i) the expiry of the holding period ; and 
(ii) satisfaction of the performance requirements. 
In light of the above, a consequential amendment was made to the retention period  applicable to these awards, being the two year period during 
which a participant must not sell or otherwise dispose of 100% or 50% of the shares released to him (other than to meet any tax liability). The 
retention period will now run for two years following the release of shares, whether on the expiry of the holding period or earlier on satisfaction of 
the performance requirements. 
In addition, to facilitate the Company's operation of the 2004(b) LTIP the Plan was also amended to permit the Remuneration Committee, at its total 
discretion and if requested by a participant, to settle up to the amount required to meet such participant's PAYE and NIC tax liability arising on the 
release of the awards in cash instead of shares. The cash payment would be limited to the amount of the tax liability and, if a cash payment is made, 
the number of shares released would be reduced by the number which would otherwise have been required to be sold on the date of release to 
meet such tax liability. In exercising its discretion in this matter which will be at the date the awards are released, the Remuneration Committee, 
in conjunction with the other members of the Board, will take into account all relevant matters including, inter alia, the financial position and share 
price of the Company and the prevailing market conditions.
Shareholding Requirement
The Company has a shareholding requirement for both Executive and Non-executive Directors.

Dilution
The only share plan operated by the Company is the 2004(b) LTIP. It is not intended to operate any other Executive or all employee share incentive 
arrangements during 2008/09. The Company has historically operated all its share schemes within the ABI dilution limits excluding the 2004(b) 
LTIP which was a unique arrangement arising from the change in corporate strategy. There has been no dilution for the purposes of the ABI dilution 
limits in the year ended 30 April 2008.
Pension 
Policy: Lower quartile to median
Messrs Pidgley and Perrins receive payments in lieu of pension at 17% and 15% of base salary respectively (all these payments are 
subject to income tax and national insurance). These payments are not included in salary figures for the purposes of determining any other 
benefit entitlement.
The other Executive Directors, Messrs Carey and Fry continue to receive contributions into their respective defined contribution plans.
It should be noted, however, that the Company does not provide any compensation to Executives for loss of tax relief. Full details of pension costs for 
Executive Directors are set out, in the audited section of the report on page 40.
Benefits in Kind
Policy: Market practice
In line with market practice, the Company's policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional benefits:
  a fully expensed company car; and
  medical insurance.
Other Remuneration Matters
All Employee Share Plans
During 2007/08 the Board of the Company consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating divisions on whether it was 
appropriate to introduce all employee share plans. The consensus view was that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving annual cash 
bonuses based on the performance of their respective divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share plan. The Board, 
therefore, does not believe it is in shareholders interests to incur the Income Statement and dilutive cost of share arrangements which would 
not have the desired effect on employees. Accordingly the Company will continue to operate appropriate annual bonus arrangements in all of 
its divisions. 
Non-executive Directors' Fees
Policy: Upper decile fees
All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the 
Articles of Association. The 2007/08 fee levels are based on a specific survey of the fees paid to Non-executive Directors in the comparator group 
by Halliwell Consulting. The following table sets out the fee rates for current Non-executive Directors in the year ended 30 April 2008 and those 
rates which will apply in the year ending 30 April 2009:

Governance r emuneration c ommittee report 38
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED The Board has decided to review the fees of the Non-executive Directors annually taking into account the following factors:
  the workload and level of responsibility of the Non-executive Directors under the changing corporate governance expectations of shareholders 
and their representative bodies; and
  the current market rate for fees for Non-executive Directors. 
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Company's share incentive schemes or performance based plans and are not eligible to 
join the Company's pension scheme. 
Executive Directors' Contracts
The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations. The only event on the occurrence of 
which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of employment; with the maximum 
payment being 12 months salary. No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation. In addition, Executive Directors will 
be expected to mitigate their loss. Further, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure. None 
of the Executive Directors' contracts provides for liquidated damages. There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors' 
contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company. Further, there are no special provisions providing for 
additional compensation on an Executive Director's cessation of employment with the Company.
Non-executive Directors' Agreements
All Non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon retirement by rotation 
as required by the Company's Articles of Association. All letters of appointment for Non-executive Directors are renewable annually on 1 May.

(1)  Up until his retirement from the Board on 31 July 2007, Mr R St J H Lewis was the Chairman of the Company. On retirement, Mr Lewis entered into a 12 month consultancy contract with the Company, 
the value of which is  240,000.
(2)  Mrs V M Mitchell became Chairman on 1 August 2007, having been a Non-executive Director since her appointment to the Board on 1 May 2002. 
(3)  Appointed to the Board as a Non-executive Director on 1 October 2007.
(4)  Retired from the Board as a Non-executive Director on 5 September 2007.
(5)  Having regard to the Lifetime Allowance introduced under the pension simplification legislation which came into force from 6 April 2006, Executive Directors may, as an alternative to receiving 
a company contribution into a pension arrangement, receive a cash payment in lieu of such pension contributions. Messrs Lewis, Pidgley and Perrins have chosen this alternative. During the year 
Messrs Lewis and Pidgley received payments in lieu of pension at 17% of base salary and Mr Perrins at 15% of base salary.
(6)  Benefits in kind for all Executive Directors, with the exception of Mr R St J H Lewis, relate principally to the provision of a fully expensed motor vehicle and private healthcare. Mr R St J H Lewis received 
only private healthcare benefits up to his retirement from the Board.
Where Directors were appointed, or resigned, during the year, the figures in the table relate only to the time when the relevant Director was a Main 
Board Director.
The release of awards under The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Long Term Incentive Plan are set out in the remaining sections of the Remuneration 
Committee Report.
Pensions              
              
Payments in Lieu of Pension            
Messrs Pidgley and Perrins (and Mr Lewis up to the date of his retirement from the Board) received payments in lieu of a pension contribution 
from the Company during the year and this is set out in the Directors' remuneration table above. During the previous financial year these Directors 
accepted the offer made to all members (active and deferred) of the Berkeley Group Staff Benefits Plan (a defined benefit pension scheme, 
which is now closed to all members) to receive an enhanced transfer value to transfer their accrued benefits from the Plan. The transfer value of 
Mr Pidgley's accrued benefits and the additional cash sum received in the year ended 30 April 2007 were  4,178,415 and  1,720,638, respectively. 
For Mr Perrins, the transfer value and additional cash sum were  147,075 and  125,705 and for Mr Lewis,  432,518 and  160,628.
For the avoidance of doubt, no amounts were paid into pension arrangements in respect of Messrs Lewis, Pidgley or Perrins during the year ended 
30 April 2008.

(1)  On approval of the Group reconstruction on 25 October 2004, the Remuneration Committee determined that the performance conditions relating to the 2003 awards had been satisfied. The participants 
received the share element of the awards during the year, having received the cash element during the year ended 30 April 2007. Following the Group reconstruction, share elements of the awards were 
converted into awards over Units in The Berkeley Group Holdings plc. On the release of the share element of these awards, the participants received Units in respect of the share awards granted as well 
as the  7 B share payments attached to those Units, which had been held in trust until their release on 22 July 2007.
The mid-market share price of the Company on 22 July 2003 was 762.5p, and on 22 July 2007 was 1,787.0p.
The mid-market share price of the Company was 1,727.0p as at 1 May 2007 and was 940.0p at 30 April 2008. The mid-market high and low share 
prices of the Company were 1,938.0p and 883.5p respectively in the year.
