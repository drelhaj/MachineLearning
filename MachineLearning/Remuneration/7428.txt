Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Membership and constitution of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, comprising the Non-Executive Directors (Mr C D Collins, Mr A M Robb and, until his retirement on 13th May, 2002,
Sir Terence Harrison), makes recommendations to the Board on the Company's overall framework for the remuneration of Executive Directors, and
also determines their individual remuneration packages (including pension rights and compensation payments). The Committee consults the Chief
Executive on the remuneration of the Executive Directors, and is assisted by the Group Company Secretary. Inbucon-Meis Limited act as advisor to
the Company and the Committee in respect of executive remuneration and share schemes. Mercer Human Resources Consulting Limited advise the
Company on pension matters. Inbucon-Meis and Mercer do not provide other services to the Group.
Compliance
The Committee is constituted and operates in accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code, as adopted by the UK Listing Authority and
annexed to the Listing Rules ( the Code'). In preparing this report the Board has complied with the provisions of the Code.
Executive remuneration policy and structure
The Group's aim is to provide remuneration packages that are sufficient to attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors of a high calibre. To this
end, surveys and external advice are instrumental in the annual review of salary and benefits packages. The Committee believes that base salary and
benefits for Executive Directors should represent a fair return for employment, but that the total reward for Executive Directors should be derived
substantially from the performance-related elements of the remuneration package (annual bonus and Restricted Share Plan awards). 
Performance-related elements form a significant proportion of the Executive Directors' total remuneration packages, aligning their interests with
those of the shareholders and providing incentives for performance. In designing schemes for performance-related remuneration, the Committee
follows the provisions of the Code. Due consideration is given to performance relative to comparable companies.
There have been no significant amendments to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director under the long-term incentive scheme
(the Restricted Share Plan) during the year.
Performance chart
The chart below compares the growth in value of  100 invested in ordinary shares in Alfred McAlpine PLC on 1st January, 1998 with the
performance of a similar investment in the shares of the constituents of the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Index and the FTSE Support
Services Index. The Directors are of the view that these constitute a relevant broad equity market index.

Basic salary
The salary of each Executive Director is determined by the Committee, taking into account his personal performance and the prevailing rates in the
employment market for executives of comparable status, responsibility, skill and position in other companies. When determining Directors' salaries
the Committee is always sensitive to pay and employment conditions throughout the Group. Independent remuneration surveys are commissioned
when required to substantiate salary levels. 
Annual bonus
The Committee determines annual bonuses. The bonuses are based upon the achievement of Group profit before tax compared with budget. This 
is relevant, stretching and designed to enhance the business. The maximum bonus achievable is 50% of salary. The Committee reviews the targets 
for the Executive Directors annually. 
Pensions policy
Executive Directors and senior executives may be eligible for membership of the Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan ( the Pension Plan'). The Pension
Plan is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary defined benefit pension scheme into which the Company currently contributes 12% of
pensionable salary, and members contribute between 5% and 8% of pensionable salary.

Annual Report & Accounts 2002
The Pension Plan provides executive members with a pension of up to two-thirds of pensionable salary on retirement at age 62, subject to completion
of at least 30 years of pensionable service. In addition, life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary is provided whilst in service. Dependants'
pensions are provided on a member's death in service or in retirement. Pensionable salary is a member's basic salary excluding all bonuses.
All Pension Plan benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits. It is the Group's policy to provide those executives who joined the Company after
May 1989 and are subject to the earnings cap ( 97,200 in the 2002/2003 tax year), with appropriate pension benefits outside the Pension Plan in
relation to that part of their salary which exceeds the cap. Executives who are not members of the Pension Plan are also due to retire at age 62.
The Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the impact of basic salary increases upon pension and associated employment costs.
Share schemes
The Company currently operates the Alfred McAlpine PLC Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 ( the ESOS 2000') and the Alfred McAlpine PLC
Restricted Share Plan ( the Restricted Share Plan'), both of which are performance-related. The ESOS 2000 replaced the Alfred McAlpine Executive
Share Option Scheme (1991) ( the ESOS 1991'), under which a number of options are still outstanding, the final grant having been made in
April 2000. 
The Group also operates an all-employee share scheme, the Alfred McAlpine Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1998, further details of which
may be found in note 21 on page 65.
There are no plans to grant discretionary options to Executive Directors who receive awards under the Restricted Share Plan. 
The Restricted Share Plan
Restricted Share Plan awards are subject to performance conditions intended to link participants' interests with those of the shareholders by
encouraging an increase in the total shareholder return ( TSR') of the Group relative to a peer group of companies and also in the long-term earnings
per share ( EPS') of the Group.
The Committee believes that TSR and EPS are appropriate performance measurements, being two key long-term indicators of a company's success. 
It is the current intention of the Committee that these performance measurements continue to apply.
Under the terms of the Restricted Share Plan, the Committee makes awards of ordinary shares in the Company which may be released if the
Company achieves specific performance criteria and the participant remains in the Group's employment. The maximum value (based on market value
at date of award) of shares over which an initial award may be made to a participant in any year may not exceed 50% of salary. Typically, initial
awards are made each year following the preliminary announcement of the full-year results. Initial awards may be made at other times, when the
Committee believes them to be justified.
The performance criterion currently used to determine the vesting of the initial awards is TSR, which is calculated by taking the percentage increase 
in the average mid-market ordinary share price of the Company for the three-year period from the date of award, plus the value of the reinvested
dividends. The Company's performance is then measured against a peer group of companies on the same basis, the majority of which are direct
competitors. As shown below, the peer group was amended following the sale of the Homes business on 1st October, 2001.
Original comparator companies (to 2001):
AMEC p.l.c. Costain Group PLC Montpellier Group Plc Taylor Woodrow plc
Beazer Group Plc* Interserve Plc Morrison Construction Group plc* Wainhomes*
Birse Group plc Kier Group plc Persimmon plc Westbury plc
Bryant Group plc* John Laing plc Speedy Hire plc George Wimpey PLC
*Beazer Group Plc, Bryant Group plc, Morrison Construction Group plc and Wainhomes were all taken over after the start of the performance periods for the Restricted Share Plan
awards. Wainhomes is not included as a comparator company for awards made after 1999. 
Current comparator companies (2002 onwards):
Amey plc Birse Group plc Interserve Plc MITIE Group PLC 
W S Atkins plc Costain Group PLC Jarvis plc Morgan Sindall plc
Balfour Beatty plc Galliford Try plc Kier Group plc Serco Group plc
Vesting may take place from the third anniversary of the initial award date. No awards vest if the Company's performance is below the 50th
percentile. Vesting starts at the 50th percentile, and 100% of the initial award will vest at the 40th percentile. Vesting is on a straight-line basis
between the 50th and the 40th percentile. If the Company's performance exceeds the 40th percentile, the number of shares subject to the award
increases on a proportionate basis, so that at the 1st percentile 150% of the number of shares subject to the initial award may vest. These additional
shares are known as Exceptional Performance Shares. Vesting may be deferred for a further period of three years in the Alfred McAlpine Employee
Benefit Trust (the Employee Benefit Trust), whereupon the shares may be matched on a one-for-one basis subject to satisfaction of a further
performance target. This second performance target requires the growth in EPS of the Company to exceed the growth in RPI by 9% over the
three-year period.
The Trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust has waived its entitlement to dividends. However, where a participant has elected to defer vesting, the
Company makes discretionary cash payments to the participant, which are equivalent to the dividends payable in relation to such shares.

Annual Report & Accounts 2002
 ESOS 2000' Executive Share Option Scheme
Senior executives are granted discretionary options over ordinary shares in the Company, at the market price prevailing at the date of grant. The
performance condition for the ESOS 2000 requires the Company's earnings per share growth to exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index (RPI) by
3% per annum over a rolling three-year period in order for the options to be exercised. The Committee believes that this performance condition is
appropriate and sufficiently demanding.
Other taxable benefits
The Executive Directors are eligible for other taxable benefits, which include a fully expensed company car, membership of private medical schemes
and top-up of life assurance premiums in respect of salary above the earnings cap.

Notes
1. The values of accrued pension in columns (6) and (7) have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
2. The value of the net increase in column (4) represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption service terminated at the
year-end. It is based on the accrued pension increase in column (2) and allows for the deduction of the Director's contribution.
3. The change in the value of accrued pension in column (5) includes the effect of fluctuations in the value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Directors, such as
stock market movements. It is calculated after deducting the Director's contribution.
4. Voluntary contributions paid by Directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
5. Increases in Mr Swan's pension are stated since the date of his appointment.
6. Increases in Mr White's pension are stated as at the date of his resignation.

Directors' service agreements and contracts
When appointing new Executive Directors, the Committee considers it appropriate to offer a two-year service agreement, reducing to a rolling one-
year term at the end of the first year. Mr Swan's service agreement may be terminated on one year's notice served at any time after 1st May, 2003.
Mr Grice and Mr Hume, who joined the Company in 1995 and 1998 respectively, have service agreements that may be terminated on two years'
notice at any time. The Committee considers that it is fair and appropriate for the Company to respect these existing contractual obligations. Details
of the Executive Directors' service agreements are set out below:

insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, fully-expensed car and pension contributions) that are not provided to the other Non-Executive Directors.

Directors' interests
Directors and all senior executives are encouraged to accumulate a shareholding broadly equivalent to one year's salary and to retain their shares after
exercising share options or after vesting under the Restricted Share Plan, subject to the need to fund the acquisition of the shares and any associated
tax liability.
The beneficial interests of the Directors and their immediate families in the share capital of the Company at 31st December, 2002 were as follows:

(i) Mr Swan's interests are stated as at date of appointment and as at the year end.
The Alfred McAlpine Employee Benefit Trust was established in 1998 and may benefit employees, including the Executive Directors, of the Company.
The Trust is able to subscribe for or purchase shares to fulfil obligations under any of the Company's share schemes. The Trustees are Mourant and Co
Trustees Limited, based in the Channel Islands. As at 31st December, 2002 the Trust held 2,119,908 ordinary shares in the Company, 386 of which
were transferred to a participant on 14th January, 2003. As potential beneficiaries, the Executive Directors are each deemed to have a beneficial
interest in all of the shares held in the Trust.
Other than the reduction in the Trust's holding referred to above, there have been no changes in Directors' interests between the year end
(31st December, 2002) and 31st March, 2003. At the date of his appointment Mr R E Hough's interest in shares in the Company comprised 750
ordinary shares and 2,000 preference shares.
