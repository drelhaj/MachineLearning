Introduction by the Chairman of the Committee 
I am pleased to present the Directors' Remuneration report for the 
year to 31 March 2011.  
The Remuneration Committee believes that over recent years it 
has met the policy objective approved by shareholders of providing 
executive remuneration arrangements that are fair and allow for 
upper quartile rewards for upper quartile performance, that align 
Directors' and shareholders' interests and that take proper account 
of risk. We believe that, consistent with this policy, the rewards 
earned by executives to date have been justified by the Company's 
performance. Despite the tough challenges faced by many 
companies over the last three years, Babcock has continued its 
strong financial performance, growing its EPS by over 60% over this 
period and regularly delivering top quartile TSR performance.  
The Remuneration Committee has devoted considerable time and 
thought over the past two years to the question of how best to 
ensure that the remuneration packages for your Executive Directors 
continue to be capable of meeting this approved policy objective 
against a rapidly changing background of the recent financial and 
economic crises and at a time of major change for the Company 
itself, following the acquisition last summer of VT Group and the 
consequent challenges that this brings for the management team 
to deliver the benefits of that transaction.  
We now feel that it is increasingly difficult for the remuneration 
packages, looked at in comparison to peers outside the Company, to 
be able to meet our objective of being capable of delivering upper 
quartile reward for upper quartile performance; this is unlikely to be 
in the long-term interests of shareholders. Nonetheless, we 
recognise the constraints within which the Company must operate. 
I hope that this Report will explain this issue and show how we are 
trying to address it in a manner that seeks to be fair to both our 
management team and to shareholders.  
 
Justin Crookenden 
Committee Chairman 
Overview 
Our remuneration policy 
The table on pages 65 to 67 summarises our policy for remunerating 
Executive Directors, how we seek to apply it, whether we think we 
are succeeding in delivering it and any issues that arise in that 
respect. It also explains arrangements for the financial year 2011/12, 
which started on 1 April 2011. It should be read in conjunction with 
the other parts of this Report which give further details on various 
aspects of the remuneration packages.  
The Committee 
Members 
Details of Committee members who served at any time during the 
year, and their attendance at Committee meetings, are shown in the 
table on page 48. All members were and remain independent Non-
Executive Directors. Kate Swann will join the Committee when she 
takes up office as a Non-Executive Director on 1 June 2011. 
The Group Chairman and the Chief Executive attend meetings by 
invitation, but are not present when their own remuneration is being 
discussed. The Company Secretary attends meetings as secretary to 
the Committee. 
Advisers 
Kepler Associates ( Kepler') were appointed by the Committee in 
late 2008 to provide it with independent analysis, information 
and advice on all aspects of executive remuneration and market 
practice, within the context of the objectives and policy set by 
the Committee. They report directly to the Committee Chairman. 
A representative from Kepler typically attends Committee meetings. 
Kepler provides no other services to the Company. 
How often it meets 
Reflecting the increasing complexity of issues around executive 
remuneration generally and the Board's determination to give 
thorough consideration to all aspects of Director remuneration in 
our rapidly growing Company, the Committee significantly increased 
the number of meetings it held this year. In total there were nine 
meetings. 
Principal areas of focus for the Committee during the year 
to 31 March 2011 
The year was, of course, dominated by the impact of the VT 
acquisition, which was announced in March 2010 and completed 
in July. 
Inevitably, the acquisition had direct and immediate implications 
for the work of the Committee.  
Revising annual bonus plans and increased share award 
for the Chief Executive  
The annual bonus plans for 2010/11 had initially been set on the 
basis of Babcock continuing on an  as is' basis. The substantial in-year 
impact of the VT acquisition and accompanying Group restructuring 
would, however, have made year-on-year comparison difficult and 
was bound to have a distorting effect on actual performance 
measurement. The Committee, therefore, devoted much time and 
attention to considering this and formulating appropriate proposals 
that maintained a fair test of executive performance.   
 65
Details of the structure of the annual bonus schemes for 2010/11 
(and also for 2011/12) are set out on pages 69 and 70 below. 
Apart from the immediate in-year impact of the VT acquisition on 
annual bonus plans, it was clear that the main strategic priority for 
the Group, in the medium to longer term, had become the securing 
of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and the challenge of 
finding ongoing profitable revenue growth. During the year, the 
Committee consulted with its major shareholders on changes to 
remuneration arrangements that support these objectives. 
The Committee decided not to make any changes to base salaries, 
bonus potential or share plans during the year, but instead, in the 
case of the Chief Executive, to make use of the existing Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) to make an additional award in recognition of the 
exceptional management challenge he now faces over the next few 
years following the VT acquisition. More information on this 
additional award can be found on page 73.  
The Committee felt it was appropriate that these issues should 
be looked at again when considering arrangements for 2011/12 
and has, as explained in the policy table, decided to repeat this 
additional PSP award for the Chief Executive; to move towards 
realignment of base salaries closer to market for the Executive 
Directors over the next few years; and to make a modest increase 
in annual bonus potential for the two new Executive Directors, as 
anticipated at the time of their appointment to the Board in May 
2010, but otherwise to leave the shape of remuneration packages 
substantially unchanged. 
The impact of tax changes on pension benefits for high earners 
Changes to the taxation of pension benefits for high earners came 
into force in April 2011, increasing significantly the tax charge in 
respect of these benefits. The Company does not compensate for 
tax changes, but accepts that the limited number of individuals 
within the Company currently affected, including some of the  
Executive Directors, may now wish to reduce their annual pension 
benefit accrual. As an alternative to continuing with their current 
rate of pension accrual and any existing supplement in lieu of 
pension benefits, the executives will be able, instead, to elect to take 
a supplement to salary, which would not be pensionable or taken 
into account when assessing annual bonus or share awards, of an 
amount (having taken into account employer's national insurance 
contributions payable on the supplement) broadly equivalent to, 
but no more than, the saving to the Company as a result of their 
reducing their pension accrual and giving up any existing salary 
supplement in lieu of pension benefits.  
Other matters  
The Committee considered other matters, including performance-
related share awards for executives generally, the Company's 
approach to general employee share ownership, a review of the 
comparator group to be used in assessing TSR performance for 
performance-related share awards, and the non-financial measures 
to be attached to annual bonus awards designed to align with the 
Company's strategic and risk mitigation objectives. 
Internal relativity 
When setting Executive Directors' remuneration, the Committee 
takes note of pay and conditions in the wider Group. Each business 
within the Group determines its own pay structures and 
remuneration in light of its own position and the employment 
market in which it operates. Hence, general pay reviews vary across 
the Group. The normal annual pay review process has resulted or is 
expected to result in general pay awards ranging from 0% to 3% 
depending on business unit. However, in addition, the significant 
changes for some employees to their roles and responsibilities (and 
to relevant comparators for those roles) following the VT acquisition 
have justified special individual reviews leading, for some, to 
significantly higher increases of up to 10% or more. 
Policy 
Our approach to remunerating Babcock's Executive Directors  
Our Policy General  
 To provide remuneration arrangements that allow for enhanced but fair rewards for delivery of superior 
performance by allowing for the possibility of upper quartile rewards for upper quartile performance, that 
align Directors' and shareholders' interests and take account of risk. 
How we seek to achieve it Emphasis on performance-related and long-term reward.  
Are we delivering? On a fair value basis around half or more of a Babcock Executive Director's package is performance-related - 
see charts on page 67 below. 
In recent years, the actual total remuneration of Executive Directors has been in accordance with our policy 
and reflected the Company's performance. However, the fair value of the overall remuneration packages for 
the Executive Directors is currently towards or below lower quartile.* 
Comments Although the current structure of our packages reflects our emphasis on performance-related pay, to deliver 
on our remuneration policy of enhanced but fair rewards for the delivery of superior performance by allowing 
for upper quartile reward for upper quartile performance, it is necessary to consider enhancing further the 
variable elements of pay and/or increasing base pay.  
What are we doing for 
2011/12? 
The Committee decided that for 2011/12 it was not appropriate to alter significantly the structure of the 
remuneration arrangements, in particular the variable elements, but to begin to address the level of base pay 
where it is at a level that undermines our general policy.

Policy (continued) 
Our policy Fixed element (base pay) 
 Base pay should be at a level that is (i) fair and (ii) capable, when taken with the gearing effect of 
performance-related pay, of delivering upper quartile actual remuneration for upper quartile performance. 
How we seek to achieve it Fixed remuneration should be at or just below median. 
Are we delivering? Market data* suggests that base pay for each of the Executive Directors was, by the end of the financial 
year 2010/11, at a level around or below lower quartile (and between 15% and 20% below market median).  
Comments The increasing disparity between market levels of base pay and Babcock base pay has in large part been 
driven by the rapid growth of Babcock. Base pay at current levels, taken together with the existing levels of 
gearing of performance-related rewards, makes it less likely that total actual remuneration can continue to 
deliver our policy as to rewarding upper quartile performance if delivered; this is unlikely to be in the long-
term best interests of shareholders.  
What are we doing 
for 2011/12? 
Consistent with its general policy, the Committee intends to move base pay towards market median and 
narrow the  gap' over the next few years. We have restricted the rises this year to no more than c. 9%. 
These salary increases for 2011 move Executive Director salaries to around 10% below market median (and 
the fair value of the remuneration package for all the Executive Directors is between lower quartile and 
median). The Committee believes that these increases are necessary to fulfil the Company's remuneration 
policy and to ensure that remuneration levels remain competitive. Salary increases were around 2% in 2009 
for both the Group Finance Director and Chief Executive (who were then the only Executive Directors) and, 
respectively, 2.5% and 4% in 2010.* 
 
Our policy Performance-related rewards  
 Variable pay should reward long-term sustainable growth and value creation. 
How we seek to achieve it Annual bonus rewards year-on-year growth in earnings as well as non-financial and financial performance 
against agreed targets; PSP awards reward a combination of TSR performance relative to the FTSE 350 
(excluding financial services companies and investment trusts) and EPS growth over three years. 
Are we delivering? The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration structure in place over the last few years has 
been appropriate, with actual total remuneration delivered over the recent years reflecting the Company's 
performance. 
Comments Although we have succeeded in delivering our policy in recent years, this is becoming more difficult to sustain 
as the fixed element of remuneration (base pay) has fallen, comparatively, relative to market* (see above). 
What are we doing 
for 2011/12? 
We have decided to increase the maximum annual bonus potential for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas 
from 120% to 125% as part of our policy, adopted on their appointment to the Board in May 2010, of 
bringing them, over time, into closer alignment with the arrangements for the Group Finance Director. 
Performance-related share awards for Executive Directors, other than Peter Rogers, will be maintained at 
150% of salary. In the case of Peter Rogers, the award will be (as it was last year) at the maximum of 200% of 
annual salary (with an extra stretch requirement for vesting of the final 50%) because we continue to regard 
as exceptional the management challenge facing him following the VT acquisition and in maximising the 
potential presented by that acquisition.  
 
Our policy Alignment with shareholders' interests 
How we seek to achieve it A major part of pay potential that is performance-related (both standalone and comparative) is delivered 
in the form of share awards, thus directly linking the Director's remuneration to the investment risk faced 
by shareholders. 
40% of annual bonus must be deferred into Company shares, which can normally only be accessed after two 
years and is subject to potential clawback, ensuring that a substantial part of the reward is exposed to the 
longer term performance of Babcock. 
Performance-related share awards (PSP Awards) are subject to comparative (TSR vs. peers) and standalone 
(EPS growth) performance over a three-year period. 
In order further to align the interests of management and shareholders, the Committee's shareholding 
guidelines expect Executive Directors to hold Company shares (derived from share awards or purchased 
by them) equivalent in value to 200% of their base salaries. 
Are we delivering? The first annual bonus payments subject to the deferral requirement were those in respect of the year 
to 31 March 2010, with the associated share awards being made in July 2010 as shown on page 72. 
All Executive Directors currently meet or exceed the shareholding guidelines (see page 71). 
What are we doing 
for 2011/12? 
No substantive changes are being made to the structure of the annual bonus scheme, share awards 
or shareholding guidelines.  
* Judged against market data based on an average of size, and size-adjusted sector, comparators compiled by Kepler Associates, the Committee's independent 
remuneration advisers.   
 67
Policy (continued) 
Our policy  Take account of risk 
How we seek to achieve it The combination of measures (financial for share awards and both financial (including cash generation) 
and non-financial for annual bonus schemes) used in performance-related pay are designed to incentivise 
sustainable, profitable growth linked to achievement of strategic objectives and risk mitigation priorities. 
Use of shares also exposes executives to the longer term risks in any of their decisions. 
20% of maximum annual bonus potential is linked to tailored non-financial measures related to agreed 
strategic and risk mitigation priorities. In addition, the award of annual bonuses is subject to forfeiture or 
reduction for poor health, safety and environment performance at the discretion of the Committee. 
Are we delivering? By these means we seek to balance short-term and long-term priorities as well as strategic, reputational and 
other business objectives. The Committee is satisfied that the incentive structure for Executive Directors does 
not raise environmental, social or governance issues by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. 
What are we doing for 
2011/12? 
We are continuing with the same approach. 
Summary of the structure of Executive Directors' remuneration packages 
Based on our policy, the principal elements of the arrangements for Executive Director remuneration in the year to 31 March 2011 were, 
and for the year to 31 March 2012 are, as summarised in the table below. Further details on the annual bonus schemes, share awards, 
and pension schemes (and pension benefits) are to be found in the following pages of this Remuneration report.

Balance of remuneration 
The charts below show the relative proportions of each element of the Executive Directors' total remuneration packages. Long-term 
incentive awards are valued on a fair value basis. The charts assume that PSP awards over shares have a value on grant equal to 150% of the 
Director's base salary (200% for Peter Rogers). These charts are based on annual bonus fair values (including the mandatorily deferred share 
element) of 72% of salary for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame and 60% of salary for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas, and Performance Share Plan 
fair values* of 65% of salary for the Directors other than Peter Rogers, and 82% of salary for Peter Rogers.  
 
  
* Note: the fair value of PSP is its long-run average outcome. This takes 
into account the difficulty of achieving the associated performance 
conditions. It also takes account of factors such as volatility, time 
value of money, risk of forfeiture, correlation between the value of 
the share and the performance conditions, etc.  Babcock International Group PLC

Linkage of remuneration to strategic objectives, risk management and its alignment with shareholder interests 
The Committee strongly believes that the remuneration of executives should be aligned with the long-term interests of shareholders and 
should support the key strategic and risk management objectives of the business. The linkage is achieved through the performance criteria 
(both financial and non-financial) used in the annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes. Examples include the following: 
Objective Annual bonus scheme metric Long-term incentive metric 
Delivering superior returns 
to our shareholders. 
Financial measures focused on delivery of 
sustainable year-on-year delivery of budgets 
and especially on growth by rewarding 
superior earnings and/or profits growth 
whilst maintaining strict control of cash. 
Objectives linked to improvement of the 
financial performance of specific business 
areas. 
Focus on delivery of top quartile performance 
and returns over the longer term. 
Securing the strategic benefits of the VT 
acquisition and the synergy benefits. 
Specific non-financial measures aimed at 
strategic benefits. 
Financial benefits factored into budgets. 
As above; but with increased incentive 
for the Chief Executive for delivering even 
more stretching returns. 
Organic growth Non-financial measures targeting win 
rates, order book and pipeline growth. 
Specific business positioning objectives 
designed to underpin future growth. 
Financial objectives. 
Long-term measures and deferral of significant 
part of bonus ensure steps taken to meet 
annual objectives are not at the expense of 
future performance. 
Developing and maintaining leading 
market positions in the UK and selected 
overseas markets. 
Specific non-financial objectives for: 
  the establishment or expansion of targeted 
domestic and overseas markets; 
  securing key business development 
milestones; 
  developing detailed strategic plans for 
expansion into target markets. 
 
Customer-focused, long-term relationships 
with strategically important customers. 
Non-financial objectives linked to customer 
satisfaction. 
 
Development of the Group's long-term 
technical and management expertise. 
Non-financial objectives: for example, the 
establishment of a more effective ongoing 
talent management and succession planning 
process. 
Retentive nature of the requirement for 
deferral into shares of 40% of annual bonuses 
earned by senior executives. 
Retentive nature of the long-term schemes. 
Maintenance of an excellent health, 
safety and environmental record. 
General underpin giving Remuneration 
Committee complete discretion over the 
reduction or annulment of bonus in the event 
of unsatisfactory performance. 
 
Balancing risk and reward. A focus on year-on-year earnings or profit 
growth remains the prominent feature of 
the bonus schemes, placing a premium on 
delivery of sustainable growth, discouraging 
short-term risk-taking and encouraging 
planning for and underpinning of future 
prospects. 
The use of financial metrics that are 
principally cash flow, profit and earnings 
driven rather than sales based discourages 
poor quality sales growth. 
The use of non-financial objectives reinforces 
links to key strategic steps or risk mitigation 
objectives. 
The requirement to defer 40% of any bonus 
into shares for two years exposes executives to 
the future impact of current year decisions. 
The long-term schemes and annual bonus 
schemes are mutually reinforcing, with the 
long-term schemes increasing the personal 
exposure of executives to the potentially 
negative consequences of short-term thinking 
and, as a further control, by requiring for full 
vesting superior performance in returns to 
shareholders.   
 69
Annual bonus schemes 
As explained in the Overview on pages 64 and 65, the Committee had to reconsider the shape of the annual bonus scheme for Directors 
during the year in the light of the VT acquisition. 
Accordingly, the Committee adopted the following structures for the year to 31 March 2011:

The maximum bonus potential for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas is increased from 120% to 125% in a step towards bringing them into 
closer alignment with the Group Finance Director, as envisaged at the time of their appointment to the Board in May 2010. 
Deferral into shares 
To ensure that a substantial part of the Director's bonus is exposed to the longer term impact of decision-making and to further align them 
with shareholders, 40% of any annual bonus earned by Executive Directors (and other senior executives) must be deferred into Babcock 
shares for two years under the Deferred Bonus Plan. 
There is no provision for the Company to match or augment these deferred shares on any basis.

insurance obligations on exercise), but do not include shares covered by awards that are not yet vested. 
3. For Alexander Hesketh, the interest in shares shown is the interest in shares on the date he resigned as a Director. 
Shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors 
The Committee sets shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors. The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal 
(and/or spousal) holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least twice the Director's annual base salary. The guidelines 
also state that normally (and subject to the Committee's discretion to allow a dispensation) an Executive Director is expected to retain 
at least half of any shares acquired on the exercise of a share award that remain after the sale of sufficient shares to cover tax and 
national insurance triggered by the exercise (and associated dealing costs) until the guideline level is achieved and thereafter maintained. 
The Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines, as shown in the table above.

CSOP = 2009 Company Share Option Plan; DBP = 2009 Deferred Bonus Plan. Further details about these plans and, where applicable, performance conditions attaching 
to the awards listed are to be found on pages 75 to 77 below. 
2. The figures for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas is as at 1 May 2010, the date of their appointments to the Board. 
3. The PSP and L-TIP awards are structured as nil priced options. 
4. Subject to the rules of the scheme concerned, including as to meeting performance targets.  
5. Where this date is less than ten years from the date of award, the Committee may extend the expiry date on one or more occasions, but not beyond the tenth 
anniversary of the award.  
6. The vesting of the CSOP award is subject to performance measures which are identical to those for the PSP award granted on the same date. The CSOP and PSP awards 
are linked so that the maximum aggregate number of shares that can be acquired on exercise of the two awards is limited to that number of shares that had a market 
value on the date of the awards (and after deducting any exercise price payable on exercise of the CSOP award) equal to the relevant grant multiple of the Director's 
base salary at the date of the awards (the  Limit'). If there is less than full vesting, it is possible for the Director to choose to exercise the CSOP to its fullest extent within 
the Limit and then to exercise the PSP award to the extent of any balance left within the Limit.    
 73
Directors and shares (continued) 
Performance-related awards made to Executive Directors in 2010  
In July 2010, PSP awards were made to each of the Executive Directors. Peter Rogers and Bill Tame also received CSOP awards linked, as 
explained in note 6 under the table on page 72, to their PSP awards.  
PSP vesting schedules - Executive Directors, other than the Chief Executive  
In accordance with past practice, the awards for Bill Tame, Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas were made so that they were potentially 
exercisable over that number of shares that had a market value on award of 150% of their qualifying base salaries. 
As anticipated in the last Remuneration report, the performance target attached to those awards - split between TSR performance relative 
to the peer group and real EPS growth (see table on page 76 for detail) - was toughened in respect of the EPS growth test compared to 
the awards made in 2009, in that maximum vesting for that element will require real annual compound growth of 12.5% or more over the 
performance period (1 April 2010 to 31 March 2013). This represented an increase from the 11% (real) EPS target applied to the 2009 
awards. The performance measures are illustrated in the charts below: 
 
Chief Executive 
In the case of Peter Rogers, in recognition of the exceptional management challenge particularly he now faces following the VT acquisition, 
and following discussions with leading shareholders, the Committee made him an award equivalent in value to 200% of his base salary. 
As regards that part of the award up to 150% of his salary, the performance measures applied were the same as for the awards to the 
other Executive Directors (above). In order, however, for the remainder of the award (equivalent on grant to 50% of his salary) to vest, 
more stretching TSR performance is required with vesting on a straight-line basis for out-performance of between 9% p.a. and 12.5% p.a. 
as illustrated below:

PSP awards to be made in 2011 
It is the Committee's intention to adopt the same approach and the same performance measures as followed in 2010 when making 
awards to Executive Directors. This will involve the grant of awards to Bill Tame, Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas over shares having on the 
date of grant a value equal to 150% of their base salaries. The same exceptional management challenge continues to apply to Peter Rogers 
and his award will be of 200% of base salary, with the additional 50% being subject to the same added stretch target described above. 
Why TSR and EPS for Executive Directors' share awards? 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance conditions to be attached to share awards prior to the start of each cycle 
to ensure they remain appropriate. No material reduction in targets would be made without prior consultation with shareholders. 
The Committee believes that continuing to use a balance of TSR and EPS performance conditions remains appropriate and provides 
a strong blend of performance metrics, in line with prevailing market practice. 
The TSR performance measure is tested by reference to the Company's relative long-term share price performance against suitable peers. 
The use of relative TSR provides strong alignment with shareholders' interests by rewarding management for the delivery of above market 
returns, whilst the use of an EPS growth performance measure focuses management on continued strong financial performance and is 
heavily dependent on the Company's success in achieving its strategic goals.  
The TSR calculation would normally use a 12-month average for opening and closing share prices adjusted for dividends paid during the 
period. The Company feels that this is the most appropriate period because a 12-month average ensures both that short-term market 
volatility is excluded and that for each company a 12-month period will capture the impact of the announcement of results and payment 
of dividends. A shorter period would not capture all these events and would not necessarily put all companies on an equal footing. 
For certain senior managers, but not Directors, the performance targets attached to PSP awards in 2009 were set (wholly or in part) 
by reference to divisional profit targets and return on capital employed or operating cash flow, as appropriate to the division's business. 
Sourcing of shares 
It is the intention of the Company that shares needed to satisfy share awards for Directors will be purchased in the market to the extent 
that they are not already held in the Group's employee share trusts at the date the options or awards are granted or are exercised, unless 
it is in the interests of the Company to do otherwise and issue new shares.  
Performance graphs  
The graphs below were prepared by Kepler Associates. They show the total shareholder return for a holding in the Company's shares for 
the period from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2011 relative to a holding of shares representing respectively the FTSE 350 Index (excluding 
investment trusts) and the FTSE 350 Support Services sector. The calculation of the return assumes dividends are reinvested to purchase 
additional equity. This FTSE 350 Index (excluding investment trusts) is a broad index that allows comparison of the Company's performance 
against the performance of the stock market as a whole; Support Services is the sector in which the Company's share price is reported. 
Over the five-year period, the Company has significantly out-performed both indices. An investment of  100 in the Company on 
1 April 2006 would have been worth (assuming the dividends were reinvested in further Company shares)  219 at 31 March 2011.

Share awards summaries 
The following tables summarise the performance targets (if applicable) and other information about the schemes relevant to outstanding 
share awards held by Directors (see also the information about share schemes on pages 58 and 59). 
Scheme 1999 Approved Option Scheme (market price options) - 2002 awards 
Performance periods 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2004 (74% vested). 
1 April 2002 to 31 March 2005 (100% vested). 
Performance target  Comparative TSR performance.  
Full vesting was for top quartile ranking, with 25% vesting for just above median, and straight-line 
vesting in between. 
TSR comparator group Companies in the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector when the options were granted 
(which was the sector in which the Company's shares were then listed). 
Other information They were not subject to re-testing. 
The exercise price was the undiscounted average of the mid-market closing price for the three 
business days' preceding the date of the grant. 
The options must be exercised before the tenth anniversary of the grant date, or earlier if there 
is a change of control, the Director leaves or dies, failing which they will lapse.

TSR comparator group For the TSR element, companies in the FTSE 350 Support Services Index on date of award: these 
were the companies in the same FTSE sector as the Company. The peer group was chosen pending 
a full review of longer term incentives and the appropriate peer group, which was carried out in 
2008/09. 
Other information EPS was subject to adjustment at the discretion of the Committee in respect of exceptional items 
and is pre-acquired intangible amortisation. 
Real EPS growth is that in excess of the change in the consumer prices index.

If comparative TSR performance exceeds median TSR performance for the peer group taken as a 
whole by more than 9% per annum further shares vest (see page 73 for further details). This will 
affect the relative proportion of the award vesting in his case. 
TSR comparator group 
2009 and 2010 awards 
For the TSR element the peer group is the FTSE 350 (excluding investment trusts and financial 
services). This group was chosen after careful review due to the fact that Babcock's closest peers 
straddle multiple sectors, not just support services, and the broader group makes the calibration 
more robust. 
Other information Participants will be entitled to a vesting of shares under the TSR element only to the extent 
the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the 
underlying performance of the Company over the performance period. The awards are not 
subject to re-testing. 
EPS is adjusted to exclude acquired intangible amortisation, but, unless the Committee decides 
otherwise in respect of any item, is after exceptional items. Real EPS growth is that in excess of the 
change in the retail prices index. 
The awards carry the right to receive on vesting any dividends that would have been paid in the 
period between grant and vesting but this right applies only to the shares that actually vest under 
the award. 
CSOP and PSP Awards are linked so that in aggregate the holder cannot get more value from 
them than a standalone PSP award of shares equal to the relevant award multiple of the Director's 
base salary. 
Exercise periods commence not less than three years from actual or nominal award grant date. 
Subject to the rules of the plan, an earlier release of shares under unvested awards may be allowed 
by the Remuneration Committee (for example, in the event of a cessation of employment or 
a change in control), but of not more than a time-apportioned proportion and then only having 
regard to the Company's performance, though the Committee has discretion to allow a greater 
proportion to be released. 
* 2011 awards will be as per the 2010 awards (with the performance period being 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2014).

Share awards summaries (continued) 
Scheme Deferred Bonus Plan (nil price options) 2010 awards 
Performance period Not applicable: the scheme is purely a mechanism for mandatory deferral of part of the annual 
bonus earned. Awards vest and become exercisable two years after the date of grant. 
Other information Awards are subject to potential forfeiture if the holder leaves before the awards vest (other than 
by reason of death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company or business in which they are 
employed ceasing to be part of the Group). 
The number of shares into which the bonus is deferred may be reduced by the Committee if the 
accounts by reference to which the bonus was calculated have to be materially corrected or if, in 
the opinion of the Committee, there is evidence that performance against performance conditions 
in the bonus year or the impact of that performance on the Group in respect of future financial 
years was or will be materially worse than was believed to be the case at the time of the original 
assessment. 
The shares carry the right to dividends paid in the period of deferral, but payable only when the 
shares are released. 
There is no provision for the Company to match these deferred shares on any basis.

Directors' pensions (audited) 
Peter Rogers does not participate in a Group pension scheme or otherwise receive pension benefits from the Group. Instead, he receives 
a supplement equal to 20% of his base salary in lieu of pension benefits. It is separately identified in the table page 77 above. 
Bill Tame, Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas participate in the Group's pension scheme (see below). In addition to benefits accruing under 
that scheme (as described below), they each received, during the year to 31 March 2011, a cash supplement in lieu of base salary in 
excess of the applicable scheme earnings cap at the rate of 15% of the excess (less employer's national insurance contributions), with the 
Director paying contributions into the scheme only on salary up to the applicable earnings cap. The value of this supplement in the year 
to 31 March 2011 is shown separately in the table on page 77. For the year commencing 1 April 2011, each of these Directors is being 
offered the option of reducing his pensionable salary in return for a new cash supplement which, if accepted, would replace the existing 
supplement and, overall, represent no increase in cost to the Company compared to the cost of meeting their pension liabilities and the 
existing supplement should he choose not to take up this option. 
Supplements paid in lieu of pension do not count for pension, share award or bonus purposes. 
Babcock International Group Pension Scheme ( the Scheme') (audited) 
Bill Tame is a member of the senior executive tier of the Scheme. Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas are each members of the executive tier 
of the Scheme. 
The accrual rate for Bill Tame under the Scheme is one-thirtieth, and for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas is one-forty-fifth, of pensionable 
salary (i.e. that part of their base salary within the applicable Scheme earnings cap) for each year of service. The pension age is 60 (for Bill 
Tame) or 65 (for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas). The earnings cap adopted by the Scheme is the same as the former statutory earnings 
cap, index-linked in the same way.  
Pension entitlements under the Scheme (defined benefit) are set out in the following table:

1. Inflation has been taken as 4.6% for the purposes of calculating increases in transfer values and pension earned. 
2. The transfer value of the increase in pension accrued is calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, and is stated after deducting 
members' contributions. 
3. The figures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benefits under the Scheme. 
4. The figures in the above table make no allowance for any benefits in respect of earnings in excess of the HM Revenue & Customs earnings cap. 
5. In calculating the above figures no account has been taken of any retained benefits which he may have from previous employments. 
6. No payments have been made to retired Directors in excess of the retirement benefit to which they were entitled on the date the benefits first became payable or, 
if later, 31 March 1997. 
Membership of the Scheme also entitles the Directors to life assurance cover of four times base salary up to the applicable pensionable 
earnings cap. The Company takes out additional life assurance cover in respect of four times the salary in excess of that cap. The cost of 
providing that additional life assurance cover was:

Other pension arrangements (audited) 
Before 1 April 2006, the Company provided a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS) for Bill Tame in respect of his salary 
in excess of the earnings cap. The Company contributed to the FURBS an amount equal to 20% of the excess (including employer's national 
insurance contributions), with him making contributions into the Company's pension scheme on his full uncapped salary.  
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors' remuneration (audited) 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive fixed fees. These fees are reviewed against market practice from time to time (by the 
Chairman and the Executive Directors in the case of the Non-Executive Director fees and by the Remuneration Committee in respect of 
the fees payable to the Chairman). The fees for the year to 31 March 2011 were those set in April 2009. Following a review against current 
market practice, the basic Non-Executive Directors' fee has been increased by  2,500 with effect from 1 April 2011 as described in the 
table below.

Kevin Thomas (Chief Executive, Support Services division) 20 April 2010 12 months from Company, 
6 months from Director 
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors' service contracts should be capable of being terminated by the Company on not more 
than 12 months' notice.  
If the Company terminates a Director's service contract, the Company will have regard to all the circumstances in determining the amount 
of compensation, including as to the scope for mitigation, if any, payable to him in connection with that termination. 
The agreements for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame (but not the agreements for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas) contain provisions which 
provide that within 90 days of the occurrence of the change of control, each may terminate his employment forthwith. If he exercises this 
right, he is entitled, for a 12-month period, to be paid (on a monthly basis) his base salary plus 40% (compared to a maximum entitlement 
under the annual bonus scheme of 150%) in lieu of bonus and all other contractual entitlements. From this there is to be deducted any 
amount that the Director receives by way of income, if it exceeds 10% of his Babcock salary, from other sources that he would not have 
been able to earn had he continued in employment with the Company.  
The agreements for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame (but not the agreements for Kevin Thomas and Archie Bethel) also provide that if the 
Company terminates their appointment within12 months of a change of control, they would be entitled to a termination payment equal 
to 100% of annual salary (plus 40% in lieu of bonus and all other benefits).  Babcock International Group PLC

* The Company's policy is for Non-Executive Directors to have written terms of appointment normally for no more than three-year terms at a time; however, in all cases 
appointments are terminable at will at any time by the Company or the Director.  
The latest written terms of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office and at the Company's Annual 
General Meeting. The expected time commitment of Non-Executive Directors is set out in their current written terms of appointment.  
Outside directorships of Executive Directors 
Before taking up any new outside appointment, an Executive Director must first seek the approval of the Chairman. Any fees for outside 
appointments are retained by the Director. Peter Rogers is a Non-Executive Director of Galliford Try plc. During the year to 31 March 
2011, he received  38,000 by way of fees for that role. He is also a Non-Executive Director (and President) of ADS Group Limited, a role 
for which he receives no fees. Bill Tame is a Non-Executive Director of Carclo PLC. During the year to 31 March 2011, his fees in that role 
were  27,500.
