Report on Remuneration and Related Matters
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 (the 1985 Act ). 
It also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes
how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice (the Combined
Code ) relating to directors' remuneration.
During the year under review, the Company complied with the detailed code provisions set out in Section B 
of the Combined Code except as follows:
  as explained on page 69, performance related pay measures did not apply to the Chairman, who was the only
Executive Director (provision B.1.1).
The 1985 Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on certain parts of this report and to
state whether in their opinion those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
Membership
The membership of the Remuneration Committee during the year was as follows:
Mr. G S Menendez (Chairman);
Mr. C H Bailey; and
Mr. D E Yarur.
Mr. Menendez, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Yarur were considered by the Board to be independent Non-Executive
Directors throughout 2006.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are fully set out in its Terms of Reference which are
available on the Company's website. The Committee is responsible for setting remuneration policy and for
reviewing the remuneration of any Executive Directors and, where appropriate, it consults the Chairman, 
Mr. J-P Luksic. The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for monitoring the level and structure of
remuneration of Group senior management and evaluating management performance.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole. No Director participates 
in the determination of his own remuneration. 
Company policy on Directors' pay and bonuses
The Company's policy is to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded with regard to responsibilities undertaken,
and considers comparable pay levels in the United Kingdom and in Chile. Corporate and individual performance
is taken into account in setting the pay level for the Chairman as an Executive Director, and this is reviewed on
an annual basis. Remuneration levels for Non-Executive Directors are based on comparable levels for companies
of a similar size and complexity, and also take into account specific responsibilities undertaken. Remuneration
includes fees paid for non-executive directorships of subsidiary companies within the Group.
The Board does not consider it appropriate to make regular performance-related pay awards such as bonuses to
the only Executive Director, Mr. J-P Luksic, given his role as Chairman of the Board and his interest in the
Company's shares both directly and as a member of the Luksic family. 
The Group has paid Mr. R F Jara for advisory services to the Group. The Board has taken these payments into
account in determining his fees as a Non-Executive Director.
No Directors currently receive pension contributions.

Service contracts
Mr. J-P Luksic has a contract for services with the Antofagasta Railway Company plc, and (from 1 January
2007) also with Minera El Tesoro. Both contracts for services can be terminated by either party on one month's
notice. There is also a contract between Antofagasta Minerals S.A. and Asesorias Ramon F Jara EIRL for the
provision of advisory services by Mr. R F Jara which can also be terminated on one month's notice. The amounts
payable under these contracts for services are reviewed periodically in line with the Company's policy on
Directors' pay. Amounts paid during 2005 and 2006 have been included in the table of Directors' Remuneration
on page 73.
No other Directors have service contracts with the Group and therefore no other notice periods apply.
Share options and long-term incentive schemes
No arrangements exist to enable Directors to acquire benefits through the acquisition of shares in the
Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, to benefit through profit-related pay or share option schemes 
or to participate in any long-term incentive schemes.
Directors' interests
The Directors' beneficial interests in the shares of the Company at the beginning and end of the year were
as follows:

Mr. J-P Luksic's interest relates to shares held by Aureberg Establishment, an entity which he controls. On 15 June 2006, 8,392,622
ordinary shares in the Company were distributed in kind to Aureberg Establishment by Sandypoint Establishment (in which it held a minority
interest) as part of a reorganisation of the structure of the Luksic family interests in shares of Antofagasta plc. This reorganisation did not
alter the combined overall percentage the Luksic family controls in Antofagasta. The interest of Aureberg Establishment increased to
41,963,110 shares as a result of the 4-for-1 bonus issue by the Company on 19 June 2006.
(2)
Mr. C H Bailey disposed of 2,000 shares on 5 January 2006, resulting in an interest of 8,000 shares. His interest increased to 40,000 shares
as a result of the 4-for-1 bonus issue by the Company on 19 June 2006. A further disposal of 8,000 was made on 19 December 2006,
resulting in an interest of 32,000 shares at the year-end.
The Directors had no beneficial or non-beneficial interests in the shares of the Company during the year other
than the interests in the table set out above. No Director had any material interest in any other contract with
the Company or its subsidiary undertakings during the year other than in the ordinary course of business.
No changes took place in the interests of the Directors between 31 December 2006 and the date of this report.

MAC_RF62790_E  13/4/07  15:25  Page 71 Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the performance of the FTSE All Share Index
over a five-year period, measured by total shareholder return (as defined below). The FTSE All Share Index has
been selected as an appropriate benchmark as it is the most broadly based index to which the Company belongs
and which relates to the London Stock Exchange, the market where the Company's ordinary shares are traded.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show a theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a specified
period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares at the closing price applicable on
the ex-dividend date. Total shareholder return for the FTSE All Share Index is calculated by aggregating the
returns of all individual constituents of the FTSE at the end of the five-year period.

During 2006, remuneration of US$607,000 (2005 - US$589,000) for the provision of services by Mr. J-P Luksic was paid to Goldstream
Finance Limited. This amount is included in the amounts attributable to Mr. Luksic of US$1,784,000 (2005 - US$1,215,000).

Mr. P J Adeane was Managing Director until 31 March 2005, after which he continued to serve as a Non-Executive Director until he 
retired from the Board on 29 September 2006. Fees paid during 2005 therefore partly reflected the period for which Mr. Adeane was a 
Non-Executive Director and partly reflected the period for which he was an Executive Director. During 2005, Mr. Adeane was awarded an 
ex-gratia payment of US$182,000; no comparable payment was made in 2006. Fees paid during 2006 reflected the period during which he
was a Non-Executive Director until his retirement from the Board. Following retirement, Mr. Adeane has continued to serve the Board as 
a Senior Advisor under a contract for services at the rate of  10,000 per annum. This contract can be terminated on one month's notice. 
Mr. Adeane was paid  2,500 (approximately US$4,600) under this contract for services during 2006, which has not been included in his 
fees as a Director in the table above.

During 2006, remuneration of US$331,000 (2005 - US$278,000) for the provision of services by Mr. R F Jara was paid to Asesorias 
Ramon F Jara EIRL. This amount is included in the amounts attributable to Mr. Jara of US$536,000 (2005 - US$391,000).
(4)
Mr. W M Hayes was appointed as a Director on 29 September 2006. Fees paid during 2006 therefore reflect the period for which he 
has been a Director.
