Remuneration report
This report sets out:
  the company's remuneration policy for its Directors for the 2006/07 financial year and which it currently intends to follow 
for the present and subsequent financial years;
  details of the Directors' remuneration packages and contracts. 
The report will be submitted for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the company in July 2007 .
Remuneration Committee
Responsibility for determining and approving the remuneration packages of the Chairman, executive Directors and certain 
other senior group executives is delegated by the Board to a Remuneration Committee ( the Committee') consisting solely of
independent non-executive Directors of the company. Those Directors who served on the Committee did so for the entire year
under review, and were:
D Shah (Committee Chairman) 
J Rennocks
Sir Nigel Essenhigh
J Crookenden
The Committee met formally three times in the year and each committee member attended all the meetings.
Biographical details of the members of the Committee are set out on page 24.
Other than the Company Secretary who attends meetings as Secretary to the Committee, no other director or executive
attends meetings unless by invitation. Mr Campbell, Group Chairman and Mr Rogers, Chief Executive Officer have attended
meetings at such invitation, but neither is present when his own remuneration is under discussion. Lord Hesketh attends some
meetings of the Committee as an observer. The Committee receives independent, market-based advice on the Chairman's,
executive Directors' and senior management remuneration from The Inbucon Group Limited ( Inbucon'), remuneration consultants.
Inbucon was appointed, with the Committee's approval, by the company (acting through the Group Company Secretary). Inbucon
does not provide other services to group companies. During the year, Mr Shah (Committee Chairman) directly commissioned
Inbucon to update the full review of the Chairman's and senior executive remuneration carried out by Inbucon in the previous
financial year.
Remuneration policy
The company's management team has a proven track-record of successfully implementing strategy, (see graph overleaf).
There is a highly competitive market for such talent. Reflecting this competition, the company's remuneration policy is based
on the following principles:
  retaining and facilitating the recruitment of talent with such proven record; and
  providing a fair sharing of rewards between management, employees and shareholders.
These principles are reflected in the remuneration packages adopted for the executives, which comprise a combination of 
basic pay, benefits, annual bonus and long-term incentive programmes. 
Performance graphs
The first graph below (left), compiled by Inbucon, shows the total shareholder return for a holding in the company's shares for the
period from 31 March 2002 to 31 March 2007 relative to a holding of shares representing the FTSE All-Share Index (excluding
investment trusts). This is the same index as used for this purpose in earlier Remuneration reports, being a broad index that allows
comparison of the company's performance against the performance of the stock market as a whole. Over the five year period, the
company has substantially out-performed both the All-Share Index (excluding Investment Trusts) and the Support Services index.
An investment of  100 in the company on 1 April 2002 would have delivered a return of  327 .
The second graph below (right) (also prepared by Inbucon) shows comparative TSR performance over the same period against
the FTSE Support Services Sector, the sector in which the Company's share price is reported.

Level and balance of remuneration
Level of remuneration
The potential level of overall remuneration is set so that upper quartile rewards can be earned for upper quartile performance,
with basic packages set having in mind the median for comparable companies. In reviewing base pay and remuneration the 
company considers both companies of a similar size generally as well as pay levels specifically in the support service sector.
Balance of remuneration
The balance of remuneration for executive Directors is set so that the major part of overall remuneration is subject to
performance, either short or long term. The balance for the Chief Executive Officer and the Group Finance Director is shown in the
graphs below, L-TIP awards are valued on a projected value basis and the graph assumes full achievement of bonus potential.
Mr Campbell as part-time Chairman has a remuneration package where the performance related element is just over 50% of
potential remuneration. Other non-executive Directors only receive fixed fees.
Internal relativity
The Committee is sensitive to the need to set Directors' remuneration having regard to pay and conditions in the group as a
whole and is satisfied that the approach taken by the company is fair and reasonable in the light of current market practice 
and in the best interests of shareholders. 
Shareholding requirements
The Board encourages executive Directors to use company shares acquired under option or L-TIP schemes to build and maintain,
over time, a personal holding of shares equivalent in value to around a year's basic pay. 
Basic pay
Basic pay is considered against other companies in terms of size, (comparing revenues, number of employees and market
capitalisation), and companies in the support services sector. Against these data sources taken as a whole, the company's basic 
pay is normally about the median. Basic pay is reviewed annually against the market.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors' fees are reviewed against market practice at least every three years by the Chairman and the executive
Directors, to whom the task has been delegated by the Board.
Performance-related rewards:
Annual bonus schemes:
The Remuneration Committee determines a performance-related annual bonus scheme for Mr Rogers and Mr T ame at the
beginning of each financial year. Neither the Chairman nor the non-executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme.
For the year ended 31 March 2007, the annual bonuses payable to Mr Rogers and Mr T ame were dependent on a combination of
the profit before tax and operating cash flow achieved by the group as against budget and growth in profit before tax over the
prior financial year, because these are key indicators of group performance. In addition, the Committee has discretion to reduce
or extinguish the bonus achieved if they consider health, safety (and now environmental) performance warrants it. 
Maximum bonus potential was 1 00% of qualifying salary for Mr Rogers (which for the year was  400,000) and 80% of basic
salary (excluding car allowance and other supplements) for Mr T ame. Maximum bonuses were earned, as profit growth was at least 20%. 
The Committee has adopted similar schemes for Mr Rogers and Mr T ame for the current financial year. 
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
Long-term incentives:
During the financial year, L-TIP awards were made to each of Mr Campbell, Mr Rogers and Mr T ame of 100% of their qualifying
basic salaries. The vesting of the awards is based on the achievement of performance criteria, half being comparative TSR
performance (against a specific comparator list) and half based upon EPS growth. Further details of the performance criteria 
are set out on pages 36 and 37 . Details of options and L-TIP awards held by the Directors are set out on pages 35 and 36. 
To aid recruitment and retention, for certain divisional senior managers, but not the company's Directors, there is a cash-based
long-term incentive scheme. This scheme has a performance period of four years and the performance targets are set by reference
to divisional profit targets and return on capital employed or operating cash flow, as most appropriate to the division's business. 
A similar scheme is in place for senior group employees (but not the company's Directors) based on eps growth over the period.
T arget bonuses under this scheme vary between participants but will not normally exceed a year's basic salary. 
Directors' pensions
Only Mr T ame currently participates in a group pension scheme. A summary of Mr T ame's pension entitlements is set out at page 34.
Neither Mr Campbell nor Mr Rogers receives pension benefits from the company; their salaries take this into account.
The company's policy is to remain competitive in the market place to attract and retain the calibre of employee it needs.
Subject to that, it is not the company's policy to compensate Directors for tax changes or changes to the taxation of pensions.

Directors' pensions (audited)
Babcock International Group Pension Scheme ( the scheme')
Mr T ame is a member of the upper tier of the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme. No other Directors are members 
of the scheme or receive pension benefits from the group.
The accrual rate for Mr T ame under the scheme is one-thirtieth for each year of service, with pension being calculated on his
base salary (up to the scheme's earnings cap ) in the 1 2 months prior to attaining age 60. Membership of the scheme also entitles
him to life assurance cover of four times base salary up to the earnings cap. For these purposes the earnings cap  means the
statutory earnings cap that applied up to 5 April 2006 and, thereafter, the earnings cap adopted by the scheme as part of its rules
(which is the same as the former statutory earnings cap, index-linked in the same way). The company takes out additional life
assurance cover in respect of four times his salary in excess of the earnings cap. 
Mr T ame's pension entitlements under the scheme (defined benefit) are set out in the following table:

(1) Inflation has been taken as 3.6% for the purposes of calculating increases in transfer values and pension earned.
(2) The transfer value of the increase in pension accrued is calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN1 1, and is
stated after deducting members' contributions. 
(3) The figures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benefits under the Scheme.
(4) The figures in the above table make no allowance for any benefits in respect of earnings in excess of the Inland Revenue
earnings cap.
(5) In calculating the above figures for Mr W T ame no account has been taken of any retained benefits which he may have from
previous employments.
(6) No payments have been made to retired Directors in excess of the retirement benefit to which they were entitled on the date
the benefits first became payable or, if later, 31 March 1997 . Babcock International Group PLC

Other pension arrangements (audited)
Before 1 April 2006, in respect of his salary in excess of the earnings cap, the company had established a Funded Unapproved
Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS) for Mr T ame. The company contributed to the FURBS an amount equal to 20% of the excess
(including employer's national insurance contributions), with Mr T ame making contributions into the company's pension scheme 
on his full uncapped salary. As from April 2006 this was replaced with a salary supplement of 15% of the excess (including
employer's national insurance contributions), with Mr T ame contributing into the company's pension scheme only on capped
salary. The cost to the company of the salary supplement arrangement is the same as was the case for the FURBS arrangement. 
The amount of contributions made to Mr T ame's own pension plans or arrangements, including the cost of providing any
additional life assurance cover, are set out in the table below:

These options vested according to performance targets based on comparative TSR performance over three-year performance
periods, which were set on grant and not subject to re-testing. The comparator group was the companies who at the date of
grant comprised the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector, in which the company then appeared. There was no vesting unless
the company's ranking at the end of the performance period was at least immediately above median in which case 25% of 
the options vested, with 100% vesting for top quartile ranking and proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis for a ranking
between those points. 
The exercise prices of the options were not set at a discount to the market value of the company's shares at the date of grant.
They were set at the average of the mid-market closing price of the company's shares for the three business days preceding the date
of the grant.
Directors must exercise vested options before the tenth anniversaries of the grant dates, or earlier if there is a change of control,
they leave or die, failing which they will lapse. 
There were no changes in the Directors' share options between 3 1 March 2007 and 22 May 2007 . Babcock International Group PLC

*Those awards shown in italics were fully vested and exercisable as at 31 March 2007 .
**Vesting date depends on the date of notification of the vesting, which must be after announcement of results for the final 
year of the applicable performance period. The above table assumes that the announcement is made in May and notification 
of vesting given in the same month.
The company's mid-market share price at close of business on 30 March 2007 (the last dealing day before the close of the
financial year) was 399.75p. The highest and lowest mid-market share prices in the year ended 30 March 2007 were 449.75p 
and 299.50p respectively.
The L -TIP awards that vested during the year were those granted in July 2003. The market value of those shares on award was
1 1 3.5p per share. On the date of vesting, 1 5 June 2006, they had a market value of 306p per share, being the mid-market closing
price on that day. The performance conditions attached to the award are described below. 
All the L -TIP awards made to Directors to date have been made by the trustee of the Babcock Employee Share T rust as
conditional rights to acquire shares (effectively nil cost options), and the number of shares awarded was based on qualifying annual
salary at the date of taking the award and the average of the mid-market closing price of the company's shares for the three business
days preceding that date. 
Subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria (see below) attached to the awards, the Directors may call for the release 
to them of the shares subject to the awards during the above shown exercise periods.
Subject to the rules of the plan, an earlier release of shares may be allowed by the Remuneration Committee (for example, 
in the event of a cessation of employment or a change in control), but normally of not more than a time-apportioned proportion
and then only having regard to the company's performance, though the Committee has discretion to allow a greater proportion 
to be released.
Performance measures attached to L-TIP awards
Performance targets set by the Committee for L-TIP awards have regard to market conditions and the need to ensure that they
serve the purpose of motivating and retaining key staff. 
Performance is judged over the period of three financial years from the start of the financial year in which the award is made.
Performance is measured at the end of the period. There is no retesting of performance.
For L -TIP awards made in 2003 there could be no vesting unless the company's earnings per share (pre-acquired intangible
amortisation and exceptional items) in the year ended 3 1 March 2006 was at least 9.27% (representing a 3% per annum compound
growth rate) greater than the basic earnings per share (pre-acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items) for the financial
year ended 3 1 March 2003. Once this hurdle was achieved, actual levels of vesting depended on the comparative total shareholder
return ( TSR') performance of the company as at 3 1 March 2006 against the shares of the companies comprising the FTSE All-Share
Index (other than Investment T rusts) on 1 April 2003. This group was selected at a time when the company had left the Engineering
and Machinery Sector, but its transition to a broader-based support services company was not yet complete. The target provided for
no vesting for at or below median ranking, 25% vesting for immediately above median ranking and 1 00% vesting for top quartile
ranking (with proportionate straight-line vesting in between). In the event they vested as to 99.4%. 
For L -TIP awards made after 2003, half of each award vests according to comparative TSR performance measured against a
specified list of companies with similar businesses (see below), and half according to growth in earnings per share. This approach 
will be taken with any awards made in the current financial year.  Babcock International Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2007
37
For the half of the share awards for which vesting depends on comparative TSR performance a ranking immediately above the
median level in the comparator table results in 25% of those shares vesting (with no vesting for ranking at or below median). 
A ranking in the top quartile results in 100% vesting. Rankings between these threshold levels result in proportionate vesting
calculated on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%. The comparator group of listed companies for the 2004, 2005 and,
(apart from PHS Group in 2006) 2006 were: 
AEA T echnology, W.S. Atkins, Aggreko, AMEC, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, Cobham, Interserve, Laing (John), Mitie,
Mouchel-Parkman, PHS Group, Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group, and WSP Group. 
The comparator group was chosen after consultation with Inbucon, with a view to giving an appropriate range of support
services providers against which to compare the company having regard to the nature of its and their businesses.
The comparator group for use in any awards made in 2007 is under review, but is likely to be substantially the same as the
above, with the exception of PHS Group and Laing, but with the possible addition of one or more other companies after further
consultation with Inbucon and the company's brokers.
For the half of the post 2003 L -TIP awards where vesting depends on earnings per share growth, 25% of the shares vest if that
growth (adjusted to exclude exceptional items and acquired intangible amortisation) over the performance period is equivalent to 
a real (i.e. in excess of the growth in the consumer prices index) compound annual growth rate of 4%, with full vesting if this reaches
8%. Vesting is on a straight-line basis for growth between those two points. There is no vesting for compound annual earnings 
per share growth of below 4%. 
It is policy that L -TIP awards are made only to Directors of the company and a limited number of other senior executives who 
are key to the group. The initial market value of the shares over which any such award is made in any year may be up to 1 00% of 
the amount of the participant's qualifying basic annual salary at the date of grant (subject to any adjustment that may be made 
to reflect the payment of employer's National Insurance). 
Service contracts
The following tables set out a summary of the Directors' service contracts or terms of appointment:
Chairman and executive Directors
Name Date of service contract Unexpired term Notice period
G A Campbell 31 July 2003 1 2 months 1 2 months from company, 6 months from Director
(Chairman) (amended by letters 
dated 5 May 2004 
and 3 April 2006)
P L Rogers 31 July 2003 1 2 months 1 2 months from company, 6 months from Director
(Group Chief (amended by letters

W T ame 20 September 2001 1 2 months 1 2 months from company, 6 months from Director
(Group (amended by letters
Financial Director) dated 5 May 2004 
and 3 April 2006)
The company's policy for Directors' service contracts is that they be capable of being terminated by the company on not more
than 12 months' notice. The company reserves the right to terminate the contracts without full notice by payment of basic salary
in lieu of notice. If the company terminates a Director's service contract (other than following a change of control - see below - 
or by the exercise of the company's option to pay salary in lieu of notice) the company will have regard to all the circumstances in
determining the amount of compensation, if any, payable to him in connection with that termination. Although the agreements
for Mr Campbell, Mr Rogers and Mr T ame contain provisions relating to a change of control, as described below, the Company
believes that they do no more than reflect what would in effect be a likely outcome in practice for these positions following a
change of control. The provisions are as follows. The contracts provide that within 90 days of the occurrence of the change of
control the Director may terminate his employment forthwith. If he exercises this right, he will, however, only be entitled to be
paid, for up to a period of 1 2 months, on a monthly basis, his basic salary (plus, in the case of Mr Rogers and Mr T ame, 40% in lieu
of bonus and all other contractual entitlements) but any amount that they receive by way of income from other sources within
that 12 month period, if it exceeds 10% of their salary, that they would not have been able to earn had they continued in
employment with the company is deductible from the amounts otherwise payable by the company. If the company terminates
the Director's appointment within 1 2 months of a change of control, the Director is entitled to a termination payment equal to
100% of his annual salary (plus, in the case of Mr Rogers and Mr T ame, an additional 40% in lieu of bonus and all other benefits). Babcock International Group PLC

For non-executive Directors the company's policy is to have written terms of appointment, with initial appointments normally
being for a three-year term, though in all cases appointments are terminable at will by the company or the Director. The latest
written terms of appointment are available for inspection at the company's registered office and at the company's Annual General
Meeting. The expected time commitment of non-executive Directors is set out in their current written terms of appointment. 
Outside directorships
The company considers that it can benefit if a Director, executive or non-executive, holds directorships in other companies 
outside the group. Before taking up any new outside appointment, a Director must first seek the approval of the Chairman. 
Any fees for outside appointments are retained by the Director. Mr T ame, executive Director, is a non-executive Director 
of Carclo plc. During the period 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 , his fees for this position were  25,000.
