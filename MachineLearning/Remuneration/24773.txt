The Board of Directors presents its Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 April 2012, which has been prepared on the 
recommendation of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee ). An advisory resolution to approve this report will be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved. 
The report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, Schedule 8 of the Large & 
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
INTRODUCTION 
This year's remuneration report is set against the strong operational performance of Berkeley in both an historical context and also relative 
to the performance of its sector.
Berkeley's strategy places an emphasis on achieving two operational measures that the Committee aims to align to the Executive's 
remuneration. The first is achieving sustainable pre-tax returns on shareholder equity (ROE ). The second measure recognises that the ROE 
performance should not be achieved at the expense of shrinking the business and that a sustainable model for shareholders relies on growth 
in the value of the land bank at the same time. The combination of these two targets is designed to provide a balance between earnings in 
the near term and creating a long term, sustainable business which the Board considers is the best way to create shareholder value.
In considering the level of the Executive's Annual Bonus Plan the Committee has previously discussed the principles with major 
shareholders and aims to set these at a level that is both challenging and sector leading. Comparing the Group's ROE to its sector over 
the last 5 years illustrates the relative performance of Berkeley and challenging targets set:
The Committee believes it is important to set annual targets that have a strong operational correlation with the performance of the 
business and are targets that the Executive team are responsible for delivering. Whilst the Committee considers total shareholder return 
(TSR) to be a helpful tool to measure performance over the long term, it believes that setting the right operational targets on an annual 
basis and putting in place a long term share based remuneration policy aligned to creating shareholder value above a hurdle level of 
return is the best way to deliver value for shareholders and to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives.
The absolute value delivered by Berkeley can be illustrated by the comparison of the TSR for Berkeley, expressed as the value of  100 
invested in the company, both from 25 June 2004, being the date on which the previous Scheme of Arrangement was announced, and 
from 1 May 2010, the date on which the current Annual Bonus Plan was introduced, to 30 April 2012:

Berkeley   321  154
FTSE 250   234  117
FTSE 100   169  111
Sector average   84  111
Over these timeframes, Berkeley has out-performed the sector average and generated additional value for shareholders over a difficult 
and challenging period. 
At the 2011 AGM shareholders approved the Board's strategy to return  13 per share to shareholders over the next 10 years, which has

KEY ELEMENTS OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY
The objective of Berkeley's remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives. The core philosophies of the 
policy are:
Fixed remuneration
The Committee sets salaries for the Executive Directors based on their experience, role, individual and corporate performance. Salaries on 
appointment to the Board are set at a lower quartile level which, based on appropriate levels of individual and corporate performance, 
will be increased with experience gained over time. 
Annual performance related pay
The Committee believes that shareholders' interests are best served by remuneration packages that have a large emphasis on 
performance-related pay which encourage the Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy. 
The chart below summarises the relative importance of the various components of annual remuneration for each Executive Director for 
2011/12, illustrating that the majority of this remuneration is performance related:
The Committee is responsible for determining the performance measures, annual performance targets and bonus awards under the 
Annual Bonus Plan.
The specific performance measures under the Annual Bonus Plan, being a return based measure (Return on Equity) and a value based 
measure (Land Bank Growth) ensure that there is a balance between incentivising the Executives to provide a sustainable ongoing level of 
return to shareholders whilst ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Company, thereby creating long-term shareholder value.
 risk. It is not in the interests of any of the stakeholders in the Company to set targets that encourage a level of risk inconsistent with the 
agreed risk profile for the Company.
Long-term sustainable performance
The reward arrangements should be designed to incentivise and lock-in the Executive team to deliver the Company's strategy and to 
ensure that they are focused on generating long-term sustainable value for shareholders. 
The long-term incentives which extend to 2021 have been designed to lock-in the Executive team for a far longer period than is typical in 
most publicly listed companies. This has helped ensure that the Executive team are focused on generating long-term sustainable value for 
shareholders rather than on meeting short term performance targets.
The chart below sets out the proportion of annual to long term remuneration of the Executive Directors, illustrating that the significant

Annual Long term
90     Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Governance
The Company's long term incentive plans are designed to align the interests of shareholders and the Executive Directors over the long 
term. They are summarised below:
2009 LTIP
This was approved by shareholders at an EGM in April 2009, and incorporates two parts:
a.  Part A - replacing the balance of the shares originally awarded under the previous 2004(b) LTIP , exercisable on 31 January 2014 subject 
to continued employment with the Company and an exercise price of  3 per share
b.  Part B - requiring maintaining a minimum net asset per share of  5.94 over a six year period, vesting in two equal tranches on 15 April 
2015 and 2016 with an exercise price of  8.40 per share
2011 LTIP
This is a ten year plan introduced in September 2011 to support the Company's long term plan to return  13 per share (approximately 
 1.7 billion), representing 183% of Net Assets at 30 April 2011, to shareholders by September 2021. This was approved by shareholders 
at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
The plan aims to maximise returns within a given level of risk, disciplining the business to make significant returns to shareholders in cash 
over a sustained period and ensuring the Group remains at the right size and balances investment and returns to shareholders. This model 
is aligned to Berkeley's ability to add value and operate in a cyclical market.
These plans are set out in more detail later in this report.
Risk adjustment
The Company's reward arrangements should contain the following elements of risk adjustment, in line with best practice:
a. a focus on long-term sustainable performance - this is set out above. 
b.  the weighting of the reward package towards building substantial equity holdings which the Executive team are required to earn and 
hold over long periods:
 -  The final shares from the previous 2004(b) LTIP will not vest and sale restrictions be fully removed until 31 January 2014, ten years 
after awards were granted under the Plan.
 -  The 2009 LTIP provides longer than market standard vesting periods - for example options granted in 2009 under Part B of this Plan 
will vest 50% on 15 April 2015 and the balance on 15 April 2016 subject to the Net Asset Value per share being a minimum of  5.94 
at the first of these two dates.
c.  the deferral of a significant proportion of annual incentive awards and clawback where there is a material deterioration in performance:
 -  The Annual Bonus Plan, whilst based on annual performance periods:
 set in each year are not achieved.
d. no reward for failure:
 -   Under the 2011 LTIP all options lapse, no shares vest and the LTIP terminates on 1 October 2015 if  4.34 per share has not been paid 
to shareholders by 30 September 2015.
Substantial equity holdings
In order to align the interests of Executives and shareholders, the Committee believes that one of the most effective ways of doing this is 
to design the reward strategy so that, provided performance is delivered, the Executive team become material (in relation to their overall 
compensation) shareholders in the Company, which the Executive Directors are required to earn and hold over long periods.
The current shareholdings of the Executive Directors as a percentage of salary, based on the share price at 30 April 2012, are set out on 
page 99 of this report.
REMUNERATION REVIEW
The Committee reviews on an annual basis whether its remuneration policy remains appropriate for the relevant financial year. Factors 
taken into account by the Committee include:
 There have been no changes to the policy following the review in the year, with the only changes to individual remuneration being in 
respect of the recent Executive appointments to the Board, where the policy is to align their basic salaries with market rate over time in 
line with increased experience on the Board. There are no salary changes proposed for the remaining Executive Directors on the Board.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
Composition and role
At 30 April 2012, the Committee comprised of three Independent Non-executive Directors, Alan Coppin (Chairman), Sir John Armitt and 
David Howell. David Howell was appointed to the Committee on 2 December 2011 and Victoria Mitchell retired from the Committee on 
the same date.
During the year the Committee met on four occasions and there were no absences. 
With effect from 13 June 2012 David Howell retired from the Committee and Glyn Barker was appointed to the Committee.
The members of the Committee have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential

In determining the Executive Directors' remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted with the Group Chairman, Tony Pidgley, the 
Group Managing Director, Rob Perrins and the Group Finance Director, Nick Simpkin. No Director played a part in any discussion about 
his remuneration. In addition, the Committee had access to information on executive reward provided to the Board by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , who acquired Halliwell Consulting, the previous advisers, in December 2008 and who have extensive 
knowledge of the Group and its structure.
The Executive Directors hold no external appointments.

Investor Relations on the Berkeley website (www.berkeleygroup.co.uk).
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2011/12 AND 2012/13
The 2011/12 financial year started on 1 May 2011 and finished on 30 April 2012.
The 2012/13 financial year started on 1 May 2012 and finishes on 30 April 2013.
The policy is to set the main elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration package against the following quartiles in the Company's 
comparator group:
Base salary Annual bonus Pension Benefits in kind Share incentives
Experience and Role  Upper decile  Lower quartile  Market practice Upper decile
For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Committee used the following comparator group of companies in the year ended 30 
April 2012:
Company name
Amec Plc Bellway plc Marshalls PLC Taylor Wimpey plc
Balfour Beatty Plc Bovis Homes Group PLC Persimmon Plc Travis Perkins Plc
Barratt Developments PLC Carillion Plc Redrow plc
The Committee also considers the remuneration in the FTSE 250 as an additional benchmark to the main comparator group set out above 
due to its relatively small number of constituent companies.

BALANCE BETWEEN FIXED AND VARIABLE PERFORMANCE BASED PAY
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance based pay for each Executive for the 2011/12 
financial year on an annualised basis.
ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
BASIC SALARY
The Committee has historically set the salaries of some of the Executives at the upper decile against the Company's comparator group 
 Executive Directors had been in their roles for a number of years.
The Committee believes that it is right to take account of the following factors in setting individual salary levels:
 In applying its policy on appointment to the Board and promotion, the Committee sets salaries at a lower quartile level which, based on 
appropriate levels of individual and corporate performance, will be increased with experience gained over time. 
The salaries for 2012/13 are set out below:

S Ellis  270,000  305,000 13%  246,000  310,500  368,000
 In respect of the other Executive Directors the Committee decided that, whilst there was a case for increasing their salaries due to their 
individual performance and the performance of the Group, no increases would be proposed in the current market.
In reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors, the Committee has also taken account of the employment conditions and salary 
increases awarded to employees throughout the Group, which were on average 4.4% this year.

Key features of the Bonus Plan
The Committee designed the Bonus Plan based on the following rationale:
Two targets - the Committee felt that the dynamic tension between operating a return based measure (ROE ) and a value based 
measure (Land Bank Growth ) should ensure that there was a balance between incentivising the Executives to provide a sustainable 
ongoing level of return to shareholders whilst ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Company. In the Committee's opinion the 
impact of these two measures over the five year plan period should incentivise the Executives to ensure the creation of long-term 
shareholder value as follows:
 should be noted that the ROE will be set from a challenging base as the Company has not taken any land write downs as is the case 
 returns, this will encourage the Company to invest or return cash to shareholders.
Level of targets - the Committee wishes to incentivise the Executives to achieve a good level of returns to shareholders whilst ensuring 
the long-term sustainability of the Company. Therefore the targets set have to take into account an appropriate level of risk. It is not in the 
interests of any of the stakeholders in the Company to set targets that encourage a level of risk inconsistent with the agreed risk profile for 
the Company. The Bonus Plan allows a close tailoring by the Committee of the performance conditions to the budget and performance of 
the Company for each financial year.
At the outset of the Plan, the Committee set the annual performance requirements targeting an average ROE of 12.5% p.a. and average 
Land Bank Growth of 10% p.a. over the full five years of the plan, which were considered challenging and stretching targets at that time. 
 at the time the requirements are set (see performance targets for 2011/12 and 2012/13 operation of the plan set out below), and these 
will be reviewed each year by the Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the 
Company, so that they continue to remain challenging and fully aligned to the strategy of the Group.
Level of awards account is deferred, the actual annual payment profile, based on, for these illustrative purposes, maximum awards each year and 100% 
satisfaction of both performance conditions, would be:
Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5
150% 225% 262.5% 281% 581%
94     Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Governance
Risk adjustment - there is a risk adjustment mechanism built into the operation of the Bonus Plan with a claw back of contributions if the 
threshold levels of ROE and Land Bank Growth are not met for any financial year during the five years of operation of the Bonus Plan. This 
adjustment mechanism ensures:
 Alignment of interests - there is a real alignment of participants' interests with shareholders:
 shares.
Operation of the Bonus Plan for the year ended 30 April 2012
The bonus payable to each of the Group Chairman, Group Managing Director and Group Finance Director is determined by reference to

2 There will be straight line bonus vesting between points.
3  The matrix demonstrates the dynamic tension between the two performance conditions. One cannot be met at the expense of the other. If the minimum 
threshold levels for either are not met, no contribution is made to the Bonus Plan account. If the minimum threshold levels of performance are not met for 
both performance conditions, 50% of the participant's plan account will be forfeited. Structuring the performance conditions in this way will ensure consist-
ent levels of ROE at the same time as the Group invests and adds value to the land bank.
4 ROE is defined as profit before tax divided by average shareholders' funds.
5  Land Bank Growth is defined as the annual percentage increase in the development margin in the land bank. This is the anticipated future gross margin 
to be earned from plots controlled and included in the Group's land bank. To be included in the land bank, management must have reasonable certainty 
that the plots will come forward for development, either benefiting from a planning consent or being on land zoned for development. For the avoidance of 
doubt, the land bank excludes plots subject to strategic land options. Calculated plot by plot, the development margin is measured on a consistent basis 
according to prevailing sales prices for revenue, historic cost for costs already incurred and prevailing prices for costs still to be incurred. It is separately dis-
closed within the annual report and the presentations to analysts. Each year the land bank gross margin is reduced naturally by the amount of gross margin 
sold in the year. Therefore, zero % growth in the land bank means that replacement matches usage.

LONG TERM REMUNERATION
This section of the report sets out the share incentives for the year ended 30 April 2012.
On 15 April 2009, at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company, shareholders approved the introduction of The Berkeley Group 
Holdings plc 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which incorporated and replaced Element 2 of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2004(b) LTIP ) and the previously approved 2007 LTIP , as set out below.
2009 LTIP Part A
The balance of the shares originally awarded under the 2004(b) LTIP (i.e. 3/12 of the shares), totalling 5,330,340 shares, were replaced by 
options with an exercise price of  3 per share granted under the 2009 LTIP . This new option is identified as Part A of the 2009 LTIP . These 
options were awarded on 29 June 2009, at which time the Element 2 awards under the 2004 (b) LTIP were surrendered.
Options will become exercisable on 31 January 2014 subject to the relevant Executive's continued employment with the Company.
888,390 options have subsequently been cancelled, as set out below.
2009 LTIP Part B
Following shareholder approval on 15 April 2009, a maximum of 7,100,000 shares were capable of being granted under Part B of the 
2009 LTIP . The grants under Part B of the 2009 LTIP are market priced options which will vest subject to:
 
 - 50% on 15 April 2016.
A total of 6,830,000 options were granted, of which 500,000 have subsequently been cancelled, as set out below.
Shareholder approval was received at the 2011 AGM to amend the rules of the 2009 LTIP so that the terms of existing options granted 
can be adjusted in the event of the payment of a cash dividend or dividend in specie. This provides that where such a dividend is paid the 
adjustment will be a reduction in the exercise price of an option by the amount or value of the dividend provided that the exercise price 
can never be less than zero and a reduction will only be made to the exercise price of an option that is not then capable of exercise.
888,390 options under Part A and 500,000 options under Part B of the 2009 LTIP have been cancelled following the settlement agreed 
between the Company and Tony Carey, as follows:
Plan Number of shares cancelled Exercise price Date first exercisable

 between the date of approval of the 2011 LTIP and 30 September 2021, provided the exercise price cannot be less than zero.
The following table sets out the cumulative dividend amounts, the relevant dates and the consequences of failing to deliver these 
amounts by these relevant dates:
Required date Cumulative 
dividend  
(on or before 
required date)
Consequences of failing to make the cumulative dividend payments on or before the  
required date
30 September 2015  4.34 Options lapse, no shares vest and 2011 LTIP terminates on 1 October 2015.
30 September 2018  8.67 Where the cumulative dividend paid on or before 30 September 2018 is less than  8.67, the 
following process determines the number of shares vesting:-
1  The number of shares capable of vesting is calculated on the level of dividend paid and 
capable of being paid as at 30 September 2018. 
2  The exercise price of the shares capable of vesting is set by reducing the original exercise 
price of  13 by the level of cumulative dividend actually paid on or before 30 September 
2021.
3  No shares will vest until the end of the 2011 LTIP period on 30 September 2021 subject to 
the participant's continued employment at this date.
For example:-
A participant is granted an award over 3 million shares
On 30 September 2018 it is determined that an additional  3 per share is capable of being paid as well as 
 Therefore the number of shares capable of vesting on 30 September 2021 is as follows:-
3 million shares x  7.34  = 1,693,846 shares 
                               13
with an exercise price initially per share of  8.66 ( 13 -  4.34).
If, however, the actual dividend payments made on or before 30 September 2021 exceed  4.34 the exercise 
price will be reduced to  13 minus the actual level of dividends paid. For example if the actual dividend 
paid was  10 the exercise price would reduce to  3 ( 13 -  10). The number of shares capable of vesting 
would, however, remain unchanged with the balance incapable of vesting having lapsed on 1 October 2018.
30 September 2021  13.00 The process is the same as above with the relevant date being 30 September 2021.
 13 paid in full prior 
to 30 September 
2021
 13.00 In circumstances where  13 per share of dividend is paid prior to 30 September 2021 awards 
shall vest in full. 
Participants will be able to exercise their awards of options from the date the cumulative 
payment of dividend equals  13 a share and may also sell any shares necessary to pay their 
tax liability on exercise.
In respect of the balance of their shares participants shall only be able to sell a maximum of 
10% p.a. of this balance until 30 September 2021 at which date the sale restrictions shall 
lapse.

OTHER SENIOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY
The Company's business comprises of a number of operating Divisions. The Committee in conjunction with the Board has, therefore, 
implemented both annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for these other senior employees of the Company 
linked to the performance of the relevant Division for which they work. Some elements of the cash bonus plans are annual while other 
elements are deferred to ensure long-term consistent delivery by each Division. The Committee, in line with best practice, continually 
reviews with the Board the policy behind the compensation plans at this level in the Company to ensure they remain appropriate to the 
market and the Company's current circumstances. It is the view of both the Committee and the Board as a whole that these arrangements 
are very effective at ensuring the delivery of Divisional performance for which these senior employees are responsible. Both the 
Committee and the Board believe that having senior employees focused on the delivery of Divisional results is an excellent way of driving 
shareholder value. 
A number of senior employees of the Company have also been granted awards under the 2009 LTIP Part B. 
SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENT
The Company has a shareholding requirement for both Executive and Non-executive Directors and these requirements and the actual 
shareholdings of the Executive and Non-executive Directors as at 30 April 2012 are set out in the following tables:

DILUTION
The 2009 LTIP and 2011 LTIP were special arrangements, approved by shareholders at the EGM in April 2009 and AGM in September 
2011 respectively.
In considering dilution under the 2011 LTIP the Committee took account of the long term nature of the plan which extends beyond the 
length of normal incentive plans.  
In addition, the Committee took into account the significant priority returns of  13 per share (representing 183% of Net Assets at 30 April 
2011) that shareholders will receive from the plan over this 10 year period, with the actual value of the awards to the Executive Directors 
based on the ongoing value of the Group following this significant realisation of current value to the existing shareholders.
Historically the Company has operated all its share plans within the ABI dilution limits. There has been no dilution other than under these 
special arrangements for the purposes of the ABI dilution limits in the year ended 30 April 2012.

OTHER REMUNERATION MATTERS 
All Employee Share Plans 
The Company has regularly consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating Divisions on whether it was 
appropriate to introduce all employee share plans. The consensus view remains that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving 
annual cash bonuses based on the performance of their respective Divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share 
plan. The Board, therefore, does not believe it is in shareholders' interests to incur the income statement and dilutive cost of share 
arrangements which would not have the desired effect on employees. Accordingly the Company will continue to operate appropriate 
annual bonus arrangements in all of its Divisions.
Non-executive Directors' Fees 
All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by 
the Articles of Association. The following table sets out the fee rates for the Non-executive Directors in the year ended 30 April 2012 and 
those rates which will apply in the year ending 30 April 2013:

The Board reviews the fees of the Non-executive Directors annually taking into account the following factors:
 The basic fee for the new Non-executive Directors for 2012/13 has been increased to the basic fee level for the existing  
Non-executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Company's share incentive plans or performance based plans and are not  
eligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' CONTRACTS 
The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations. The only event on the 
occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of 
 liquidation. In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss. Further, the Committee ensures that there have been 
no unjustified payments for failure. None of the Executive Directors' contracts provides for liquidated damages. There are no special 
provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors' contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the 
Company. Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Director's cessation of 
employment with the Company.
The Company settled the litigation brought by Tony Carey against The Berkeley Group plc, St George PLC and other parties for age 
discrimination and unfair dismissal for  5 million prior to the year end and shortly before the commencement of a three week hearing in 
the Employment Tribunal. The Board's decision to settle was unanimous having regard to legal advice, the size of the claim and the 
inevitable diversion of resources to run the action. Following the settlement, option rights over 1,388,390 shares, being 888,390 options 
under Part A and 500,000 options under Part B of the 2009 LTIP , have been cancelled.
