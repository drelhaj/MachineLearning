REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Role of the Remuneration Committee and Terms of Reference
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible for considering and making recommendations to the board on:
the Company's general policy on executive and senior management remuneration;
the specific remuneration packages for executive directors of the Company, including basic salary, performance-based short 
and long term incentives, pensions, and other benefits; and
the design and operation of the Company's share incentive schemes.
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee can be found on the Anglo American website and copies are available on request. 
The Committee met five times during 2004.
Membership of the Committee 
The Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors during the year ended 31 December 2004: 
R J Margetts (chairman);
D J Challen;
Dr C E Fay; and
F T M Phaswana.
The Company's chairman and chief executive attend the Committee meetings by invitation and assist the Committee in its
considerations, except when issues relating to their own compensation are discussed. No directors are involved in deciding their 
own remuneration. In 2004 the Committee was advised by R J King and C B Corrin (Group Human Resources), the Company's
finance function and by Ernst & Young LLP (who were appointed by the Committee to act as independent advisors).
In 2004, the Committee also received advice from:
Monks Partnership (a subsidiary of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP) - appointed by the Company, with the agreement 
of the Committee, to provide market remuneration data; 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP - appointed by the Company, with the agreement of the Committee, to provide specialist 
valuation services; and
Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited - appointed by the Company, with the agreement of the Committee, to provide specialist 
actuarial advice.
In addition, Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited (Mercer) is engaged by the Committee to review the Committee's processes
on an annual basis in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes that the Company and the
Committee have followed are in line with the stated policy as set out below, and that the Committee has operated within its Terms
of Reference. A summary of the letter from Mercer containing the conclusions of their review of the Committee's executive
remuneration processes for 2004 can be found on page 43, whilst the full letter can be found on the Company's website.
In 2004 the advisors to the Committee provided other services to the Company in the UK on the following basis:
Advisors Nature of other services
Ernst & Young LLP General tax advice
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Taxation and payroll advice; investment advisors and actuaries for various 
pension schemes; advisors on internal audit projects 
Mercer group companies Investment advisors and actuaries for various pension schemes
Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited Investment advisors and actuaries for various pension schemes
Certain overseas operations within the Group are also provided with audit and non-audit related services from Ernst & Young's,
PricewaterhouseCoopers' and Mercer's worldwide member firms. The Company's auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have not provided 
advice to the Committee; however, in their capacity as Group auditors, they do undertake an audit of all remuneration elements.
7878v03_GC_Rp_28-p39_020305.qxp  4/3/05  2:09 am  Page 28 REMUNERATION POLICY
Anglo American's remuneration policy is formulated to attract and retain high calibre executives and motivate them to develop and
implement the Company's business strategy in order to optimise long term shareholder value creation. It is the intention that this
policy should conform to best practice standards and that it will apply for 2005 and subsequent years, subject to ongoing review 
as appropriate. The policy is framed around the following key principles:
total rewards will be set at levels that are sufficiently competitive to enable the recruitment and retention of high calibre executives;
total incentive-based rewards will be earned through the achievement of demanding performance conditions consistent with 
shareholder interests;
incentive plans, performance measures and targets will be structured to operate soundly throughout the business cycle; 
the design of long term incentives will be prudent and will not expose shareholders to unreasonable financial risk;
in considering the market positioning of reward elements, account will be taken of the performance of the Company 
and of the individual executive director; and
reward practice will conform to best practice standards as far as reasonably practicable. 
Representatives of the Company's principal investors are consulted on changes to remuneration policy.
Elements of executive director remuneration
Each executive director's total remuneration consists of salary, annual bonus, long term incentives and benefits. An appropriate
balance is maintained between fixed and performance-related remuneration and between elements linked to short term financial
performance and those linked to longer term shareholder value creation. 
Assuming on-target performance, the Committee's policy is that at least 50% (60% for the chief executive) or more of total
executive director remuneration is performance-related. In 2004, 67% of the chief executive's remuneration on an expected value
basis was performance-related; for the other executive directors, on average the figure was 61% (see illustrative charts below). 
Shareholders approved the introduction of the new Bonus Share Plan (BSP) at the AGM in 2004. Taken together, the BSP and the
existing Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) are designed to clearly underpin the Company's existing performance culture by creating 
a better linkage between shareholder value creation and executive reward. The combination of performance measures provides a
thorough assessment of value-driven performance. The Committee monitors closely the relevance and appropriateness of the
performance measures and targets applicable to the BSP and LTIP. These performance conditions may be amended by the Committee
only to the extent that they are a fairer measure of performance, consistent with the original performance conditions and no less
demanding. The level of share-based remuneration within the reward mix will ensure that executive directors and other levels of
management have a meaningful level of exposure to the Company's share price performance.

Basic salary
The basic salary of the executive directors is reviewed annually and is targeted at the median of companies of comparable size,
market sector, business complexity and international scope. Company performance, individual performance and changes in
responsibilities are also taken into consideration in setting salary levels each year.
Bonus Share Plan
The BSP was operated for the first time during 2004 and all executive directors are eligible to participate in it. 
The BSP requires executive directors to invest a significant proportion of their remuneration in shares, thereby more closely aligning
their interests with those of shareholders, and encourages management at all levels to build up a meaningful personal stake in the
Company. Awards under the BSP are made annually and consist of three elements: a performance-related cash element, an equal
amount, as a conditional award, of Bonus Shares and an additional performance-related element in the form of Enhancement Shares.
These bonus awards are not pensionable. The BSP operates as follows:
the value of the bonus is calculated by reference to achievement against annual performance targets. The performance measures
for the BSP include measures of corporate and, where applicable, business unit performance as well as the achievement of
specific individual objectives. For executive directors, the corporate element is based on stretching Earnings Per Share (EPS)
targets which are calculated using headline earnings (defined in note 12 of the financial statements). In 2004, the EPS targets
were met in full; 
the Committee reviews these measures annually to ensure they remain appropriate and sufficiently stretching in the context 
of the economic and performance expectations for the Company and its operating businesses; 
it is the Committee's usual policy to base 70% of each annual bonus award on the corporate or business measure and the
remaining 30% on key personal performance measures. The level of bonuses payable will be reduced if certain overall safety
improvement targets are not met. Bonus parameters are set on an individual basis;
in the case of the directors and top tier of management, half of the bonus is paid in cash. The cash element would not normally
exceed 75% of basic salary for the chief executive and 60% of basic salary for the other executive directors. The other half of
the bonus is in the form of a conditional award of Bonus Shares equal in value to the cash element. These Bonus Shares vest 
only if the participant remains in employment with the Group until the end of a three year holding period, or is, in the view of the
Remuneration Committee, deemed to be a  good leaver'; and
in order to provide continuing focus on medium term performance, executive directors will also receive an award of conditional
Enhancement Shares at the same time as the award of Bonus Shares. The maximum potential, at face value, of the
Enhancement Shares is 75% of the face value of the Bonus Shares (i.e. in the case of the chief executive a maximum of 56% 
of basic salary). Awards of Enhancement Shares made in 2004 will vest after three years only to the extent that a challenging
performance condition, based on EPS growth against the UK Retail Price Index (RPI), is met, as shown below:
Real EPS has been selected as the most appropriate performance measure for this element of the plan because it is a fundamental
financial performance indicator, both internally and externally, and links directly to Anglo American's long term objectives of
maintaining and improving earnings. The targets were approved by the Committee after reviewing industry performance over a
number of years and have been set at a level which provides stretching performance levels for management. At the end of each
performance period, the level of performance achieved and the proportion of awards vesting will be published in the subsequent
remuneration report. 
In 2004, only executive directors and the top tier of management worldwide (circa 50 individuals) participated in the BSP. In 2005,
it is intended that participation in the BSP will be extended to other tiers of senior management globally (circa 1,300 individuals)
who will thereafter cease to receive grants under the Company's Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS).

Share option and all employee schemes
No share options were granted to executive directors under the ESOS in 2004 and, as noted above, future grants under the ESOS
will be discontinued, other than for use in recruitment or other exceptional circumstances.
Executive directors remain eligible to participate in the Company's Save As You Earn (SA YE) and Share Incentive Plan (SIP) schemes.
As these schemes are open to all UK employees, performance conditions do not apply.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Grant levels
Conditional LTIP awards continue to be made annually to executive directors. Awards under the LTIP in 2004 were increased from
120% to 160% of basic salary for the chief executive and from 100% to 130% of basic salary for the other executive directors.
Awards were raised in order to maintain market competitiveness and to reflect the rebalanced incentive structure. These awards are
discretionary and are considered on a case-by-case basis. In exceptional circumstances and in order to accommodate changing market
conditions, individual awards may be made up to a maximum of two times' basic salary per annum.
Performance measures
As in previous years, vesting of LTIP awards made during 2004 is subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets,
relating to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and to an operating measure, currently Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), over a fixed
three year period. In previous years, executive directors with direct divisional responsibility were measured partially on divisional
ROCE as well as Group ROCE. However, all awards made in 2004 and thereafter will be measured only on Group ROCE, in order to
provide a simpler and more coherent focus on overall Group performance. Half of each award made to a director, therefore, is subject
to a Group TSR measure while the other half of each award is subject to a Group ROCE measure. These performance measures were
selected on the basis that they clearly foster the creation of shareholder value. At the end of each performance period, the level of
ROCE performance achieved and the level of award earned will be published in the subsequent remuneration report. There is no
retesting of performance.
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executive directors by rewarding superior shareholder and financial
performance and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in the Company.
Total Shareholder Return
The Committee considers comparative TSR to be a suitable long term performance measure for the Company's LTIP awards.
Executives benefit only if shareholders have enjoyed returns on their investment which are superior to those that could have been
obtained in other comparable companies. 
The vesting of that part of the LTIP award contingent upon TSR performance varies according to the Company's TSR over the
performance period, relative to a weighted basket of international natural resource companies (the Index). The Index comprises 
three categories: the first consists of a minimum of five international diversified mining companies, the second a minimum of five
international paper and packaging companies and the third a minimum of four international industrial minerals companies. Each
category is weighted to reflect Anglo American's business mix. The Committee may amend the list of comparator companies in 
the Index, and the relative weightings, if circumstances make this necessary (for example, as a result of takeovers or mergers 
of comparator companies in the Index). In calculating TSR, it is assumed that all dividends are reinvested.
For awards made in 2004, the companies constituting the Index were as follows:
Mining Paper and Packaging Industrial Minerals
Category weighting 71% 17% 12%
Comparator companies BHP Billiton plc M-real Corporation Aggregate Industries plc
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce Sappi Limited CRH plc

Shares contingent on TSR performance will vest as follows:

Equal to the weighted average TSR of the Index 50
Equal to the weighted average TSR of the top two companies in each category 100
Equal to or greater than the weighted average TSR of the top company in each category 150
Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between 50% and 100% and between 100% and 150% as described above.
A graph showing the Company's TSR performance against the weighted average of the Index as shown above for the five years from
1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004 can be found on page 35; for the purposes of drawing this graph, Companhia Vale do Rio
Doce and Xstrata plc were excluded as they were not listed at the beginning of the period depicted by the graph.
Return On Capital Employed
Group ROCE is the second performance measure for LTIP grants. The board considers this to be among the most important factors
which drive sustainable improvements in shareholder value in a natural resources business, as well as one of the most important
measures of differentiation in performance in this sector.
The proportion of shares vesting based on Group ROCE will vary according to the degree of improvement in the Group's average
annualised ROCE over the performance period.
The Committee sets minimum targets for improvement in returns on both capital employed for the financial year preceding the start of
the performance period (existing capital employed) and on the additional capital employed during the performance period (incremental
capital employed). The maximum ROCE targets are based on stretching levels of return on the existing capital employed. 
The targets for each element of the LTIP conditionally awarded in 2004 are shown below. These are adjusted for movements in
commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects, capital in progress and for relevant changes in the composition of the Group.

Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the minimum target and the maximum target.
Vesting of share incentives in the event of change of control or termination of employment
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the following provisions apply under the Company's incentive plans:
share options granted under the former ESOS may be exercised irrespective of whether the applicable performance conditions
have been met; 
the number of shares that vest under the LTIP will be calculated by reference to the extent to which the applicable performance
conditions have been met at the time of the change of control;
participants will be entitled to receive their bonus and matching shares under the former Deferred Bonus Plan;
Bonus Shares awarded under the BSP will be released and Enhancement Shares awarded under that plan will vest, only to the
extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied; 
SA YE options may be exercised (to the extent of savings at the date of exercise); and
participants may direct the SIP trustee as to how to deal with their SIP shares (although the Matching Shares may be forfeited 
in some circumstances).
In the event that a director's employment is terminated, vesting of outstanding share options is dependent upon the reasons the
contract is terminated. Performance conditions fall away in the event of redundancy. However, if the executive resigns voluntarily,
then all options lapse unless the Committee determines otherwise. 
In the case of LTIP interests, if a director resigns voluntarily, then his interests lapse. If he is made redundant, vesting at the end of
the performance period is based on the normal performance criteria and then pro-rated for the proportion of the performance period
for which the director served. 
7878v03_GC_Rp_28-p39_020305.qxp  4/3/05  2:10 am  Page 32 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 33
In the case of the BSP, if a director ceases to be employed before the end of the year in respect of which the annual performance
targets apply, then no award will be made unless the Committee determines otherwise (taking into account the proportion of the year
for which the director was an employee of the Group and of performance to date against the annual performance targets at the date 
of cessation). If a director resigns before the end of the three year vesting period, the Bonus Share awards lapse and the Enhancement
Shares are forfeited. If a director is made redundant, Bonus Share awards will be transferred as soon as practicable after the date of
leaving and the Enhancement Shares will vest at the end of the performance period, to the extent that the performance conditions
have been met.
Pensions
Pension and life insurance benefits for executive directors reflect practice in the countries in which they perform their principal duties.
Pension arrangements are tailored to take account of historic obligations and, insofar as agreed by the Committee, the personal
circumstances of each executive. Details of individual pension arrangements are set out on pages 39 and 40.
The Remuneration Committee is considering the impact on UK pension arrangements of the new UK pensions regime which will apply
from April 2006. Further details will be disclosed in the 2005 remuneration report.
Other benefits
Executive directors are entitled to the provision of either a car allowance or a fully expensed car, medical insurance, death and
disability insurance, social club membership (in accordance with local market practice), limited personal taxation/financial advice 
and reimbursement of reasonable business expenses. Directors based in South Africa are eligible to receive housing loan subsidies 
at a preferential interest rate in accordance with local market practice. The provision of these benefits is considered to be market
competitive in the appropriate locality for executive director positions.
Executive shareholding targets
Within five years of their appointment, executive directors are expected to acquire a holding of shares with a value of two times'
basic salary in the case of the chief executive and one times' basic salary in the case of other executive directors. 
The Remuneration Committee will consider achievement against these targets when making grants under the various long term
incentive plans.
External appointments
Executive directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices without the approval of the board; if approved, they
may retain the fees payable from one such appointment. During the year ended 31 December 2004, B E Davison retained fees 
from one appointment amounting to  16,000.
Policy on non-executive directors' remuneration
Non-executive directors' remuneration is approved by the board as a whole on the recommendation of the chairman and 
executive directors.
The Company's policy on non-executive directors' remuneration is based on the following key principles. Remuneration should be: 
sufficient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent; 
consistent with recognised best practice standards for non-executive directors' remuneration;
in the form of cash fees, but with the flexibility to forgo all or part of such fees, to subscribe for shares in the Company 
if the non-executive director so wishes (after deduction of applicable income tax and social security contributions); and 
set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the board and its committees. 
Non-executive directors may not participate in the Company's annual bonus plan, share option schemes, Long Term Incentive Plan 
or pension arrangements.
The board reviews non-executive directors' fees periodically to ensure they remain market competitive. Additional fees are paid 
to the chairmen of board committees and to the senior independent director. Where non-executive directors have executive board
roles within subsidiaries of the Company, then they may also receive additional remuneration on account of these increased
responsibilities. With the exception of R M Godsell, who is remunerated by AngloGold Ashanti Limited in his capacity as its chief
executive, none of the non-executive directors has any such role.
Chairman's fees
The chairman's fees are approved by the board (in the absence of the chairman) on the recommendation of the Committee and chief
executive, who take external advice on market comparators.

Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that the period of notice for executive directors will not exceed 12 months. 
In order properly to reflect their spread of responsibilities, all the executive directors, with the exception of A W Lea, who is
employed by Anglo American International (BVI) Limited, have contracts with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited and with
Anglo Operations Limited. The salaries under these contracts are payable in sterling and/or South African rand as appropriate. The
employment contracts of all executive directors are terminable at 12 months' notice by either party.

At each annual general meeting (AGM) all those directors who have been in office for three years or more since their election or last re-election shall retire from office. Details of those retiring by
rotation this year are contained in the Notice of AGM. In addition, a director may at any AGM retire from office and stand for re-election.
The contracts of executive directors contain a provision that sets out the compensation payable in lieu of notice if the Company
terminates the contract (other than for cause) or if the executive director resigns in circumstances where there has been a material
adverse change in role, responsibilities or remuneration. Compensation is based on the value of 12 months' basic salary, target
annual bonus for 12 months and the annual value of benefits. The Company may choose whether to continue to provide other
benefits during any notice period or to pay an amount equal to the gross value of these benefits over the period. Although the
Committee notes that this policy is no longer in complete compliance with the latest ABI guidelines, it has enabled the Company 
to remain market competitive in an historic context. As market practice has now moved away from the inclusion of liquidated
damages in service contracts, the Committee will review this policy in 2005 for new appointments to the board.
The contracts of executive directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company.
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three years from their date of
appointment, subject to re-election at the AGM. In addition to his letter of appointment with the Company, R M Godsell has a 
service contract with AngloGold Ashanti Limited, an independently managed subsidiary of the Company, in his capacity as its 
chief executive. Under this contract, his employment may be terminated by either party giving to the other 12 months' notice.

Historical comparative TSR performance graphs
The graphs below represent the comparative TSR performance of the Company from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. 
In drawing these graphs it has been assumed that all dividends paid have been reinvested.
The first graph shows the Company's performance against the performance of the FTSE 100 Index, chosen as being a broad equity
market index consisting of companies of comparable size and complexity to Anglo American plc. This graph has been produced in
accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The second graph shows the Company's performance against the weighted comparator group used to measure company performance
for the purposes of the vesting of LTIP interests awarded in 2002. This graph gives an indication of how Anglo American plc is
performing against the targets in place for LTIP interests already granted, although the specifics of the comparator companies for
each year's interests may vary to reflect changes such as mergers and acquisitions amongst the Company's competitors or changes
to the Company's business mix.
The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is calculated in accordance with the LTIP rules. In particular, TSR is calculated in US
dollars, and the TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the six month period 
up to and including that date.
REMUNERATION OUTCOMES DURING 2004
The information set out in sections one to eight below has been subject to audit.

Subsequent to their retirement from the board in 2001, L Boyd and M W King continue to hold non-executive directorships with certain listed subsidiaries of the Group. They received fees of
 29,000 (2003:  29,000) and  21,000 (2003:  26,000) respectively, for the provision of these services during the year. 
(2)
As A J Trahar, B E Davison and W A Nairn had no provision for past service in respect of their sterling-denominated pension fund, their employing company has contractually agreed that
supplementary pension contributions should be made to the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme in return for these executives having given up their right to part of their
future basic salary. The table above includes these amounts, which are  89,000,  47,000 and  42,000 respectively. 
(3)
The 2004 performance bonus represents the cash element of the Bonus Share Plan payable in 2005. The share elements under this scheme for 2004 will be awarded during 2005.
(4)
Each director received a car allowance or a fully expensed car and a limited amount of personal taxation/financial advice. All directors received death and disability insurance and, with the exception
of W A Nairn, also received medical insurance. A J Trahar, A W Lea and W A Nairn received club membership; in addition, A J Trahar received a housing loan subsidy.
(5)
On retirement at 31 December 2004, W A Nairn received payment for accumulated untaken leave of  19,000 and an award to mark completion of 40 years of service of  2,000.

In light of his retirement on 31 December 2004, W A Nairn was not granted conditional awards under the BSP.
(2)
The BSP was approved by shareholders in 2004, as a replacement for the ESOS and the Deferred Bonus Plan. No BSP interests vested during 2004.
(3)
The value of the bonus under the BSP is calculated by reference to measures of both corporate performance (based on stretching EPS targets) as well as the achievement of specific individual
objectives. Details of the performance conditions applying to bonuses in 2004 are described in further detail on page 30. In 2004, the EPS targets were met in full. Half of the bonus is paid in
cash (which would not normally exceed 75% of basic salary for the chief executive and 60% of basic salary for the other directors) and the other half takes the form of a conditional award of
Bonus Shares equal in value to the cash element. The Bonus Shares vest if the director remains in employment with the Group until the end of a three year holding period. The market price of the
shares at the date of award of Bonus Shares made in 2004, in respect of 2003 performance, was  11.36 per share.
(4)
A conditional award of Enhancement Shares was made at the same time as the award of Bonus Shares (to a maximum of 75% of the face value of the Bonus Shares). Enhancement Shares
awarded in 2004 will only vest to the extent that a challenging performance condition based on EPS growth against the UK Retail Price Index is met. Further details of this performance condition
are provided on page 30. The market value of the shares on the date of award of the Enhancement Shares in 2004 was  11.36 per share.

(1)
The LTIP awards made in 2004 are conditional on two performance conditions as outlined on page 31: the first based on the Company's TSR relative to a weighted group of international natural
resource companies and the second based on an underlying operating measure which focuses on raising Anglo American's ROCE in the medium term. Further details on the structure of the LTIP, 
the required level of performance for the 2004 award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 31 and 32. A second award during 2004, included in the table
above, was made to the executive directors subsequent to the AGM at which the BSP was approved (and the consequent rebalancing of the incentive structure as outlined on page 30). 
The market prices of the shares at the dates of award were  12.62 and  12.34 per share respectively.
(2)
The performance period applicable to each award is three years. The performance period relating to the 2001 LTIP awards (which were granted on 26 June 2001) ended on 31 December 2003.
Vesting was subject to two performance conditions: the first based on the Company's TSR relative to a weighted group of international natural resource companies and the second based on an
underlying operating measure which focused on improvements in the Company's ROCE in the medium term. Part of each award was based on the TSR measure and part on the operating measure.
The market price of the shares at the date of the first LTIP awards was  10.30 per share. The market price of the shares at the date of vesting of such awards was  13.07 per share.

W A Nairn 18,194 26/06/2001 10.30 13.07 237,796
In the case of the first LTIP awards, granted in 2001, for all executive directors except for B E Davison, the determinants for vesting
were 50% on relative TSR and 50% on meeting specified Group ROCE targets. In the case of B E Davison, to reflect his responsibility
for Anglo Platinum, in 2001 the targets were 50% relative TSR, 30% Group ROCE targets and 20% on Anglo Platinum specific
ROCE targets. The ROCE targets are a function of targeted improvement in returns on existing capital employed at the start of the
performance period and targeted returns in excess of the cost of capital on new capital investment over that period. The entry level
target for any LTIP has been the actual return achieved on the capital employed, excluding capital work in progress, in the year
immediately preceding the commencement of the performance period. In order to maintain the effectiveness of the plan in driving 
long term performance, the actual returns in the final performance year are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain
foreign exchange rate effects (e.g. translation windfalls), capital in progress (to reflect the fact that mines under construction absorb
large amounts of capital before producing a return), for relevant changes in the composition of the Group (e.g. significant acquisitions
and disposals) and other one-off factors which would otherwise result in a misleading outcome.
The threshold blended target (i.e. the target on existing and new capital) for the period was 17.4% and the upper blended target
19.4%. The ROCE achieved was 18.6% and the outcome on this element of the LTIP was thus 61.7%. On the TSR measure, 
Anglo American achieved a TSR over the three year performance period of 60% which generated a 54% vesting in terms of the
2001 Comparator Group. The overall vesting level for those directors with a 50% Group ROCE, 50% TSR split was therefore
57.9%. In the case of B E Davison, the ROCE element attributable to Anglo Platinum's ROCE (20% of the total 2001 LTIP) failed 
to meet the threshold target. The overall outcome in his case therefore was 45.5%.

Certain of the executive directors were granted share options prior to 1 January 1999 under a previous share option scheme operated by Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited which
were  rolled over' into Anglo American plc options.
(2)
Share options in respect of shares, the market price for which as at 31 December 2004 is equal to, or exceeds, the option exercise price. As at 31 December 2004, there were no share options
with an exercise price above the market price.

Options were granted having UK Inland Revenue approval (Approved Options) and without such approval (Unapproved Options). The exercise of these historical options is subject to Anglo
American's EPS (calculated in accordance with FRS 14, based on the Company's headline earnings measure) increasing by at least 6% above the UK Retail Price Index over a three year period. 
If the performance condition is not met at the end of the first three year period, then performance is retested each year over the ten year life of the option on a rolling three year basis. 
Options are normally exercisable, subject to satisfaction of the performance condition, between three and ten years from the date of grant.

5. Deferred Bonus Plan and Share Incentive Plan
In 2003 and earlier years, executive directors were required to defer 50% of their annual bonus under the Deferred Bonus Plan and
could, at the discretion of the Committee on a year-by-year basis, defer all of their bonus (net of tax) to acquire shares in the
Company. If these shares are held for three years they will be matched by the Company on a one-for-one basis, conditional upon the
executive director's continued employment. No further awards were made to directors under the Deferred Bonus Plan during 2004.
The directors hold interests in deferred bonus matching shares as follows:

A J Trahar, A W Lea and W A Nairn each purchased 123 shares under the SIP scheme during the year in addition to the 205 shares
held by each of them at the beginning of the year. If these shares are held for three years, they will be matched by the Company 
on a one-for-one basis, conditional upon the director's continued employment. Participants in the SIP scheme are entitled to receive
dividends from these matching shares upon vesting. No SIP matching shares vested during 2004.
6. Pensions
Directors' pension arrangements
Each executive director, other than A W Lea, is a member of the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme
(the International Scheme), which is a defined contribution pension scheme.
A J Trahar participates in the International Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited for
services to be rendered outside South Africa. Normal contributions were made on his behalf into the International Scheme at the rate
of 35% of the basic salary payable under this contract. He also participates in the Anglo American Corporation Pension Fund
(the Pension Fund) in respect of his South African contract, whereby he accrues an annual pension at the rate of 2.2% of
pensionable salary (as defined in the rules of that scheme) for each year of pensionable service. The Pension Fund provides spouse's
benefits of two-thirds of the member's pension on the death of a member. It does not have provision for guaranteed pension
increases.
Following previously announced senior management changes in South Africa, A J Trahar will increase the time he devotes to Group
matters globally. Accordingly, the Committee has decided that, with effect from January 2005, the proportion of his overall
remuneration paid under his South African contract will be reduced. The Committee has been advised that, as a consequence, his
pension payable on retirement out of the Pension Fund (his South African final salary defined benefit scheme) will be substantially
less than he would otherwise have accrued. The Committee has also been advised by independent professionally qualified actuaries
that to provide benefits of equivalent value to those forgone would require additional contributions into the International Scheme
amounting to  5.6 million, during 2005, which the Committee has decided should be paid. Normal contributions will continue to be
paid into the International Scheme with effect from January 2005, at the rate of 35% of the basic salary payable under his contract
with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited.
A W Lea participates in the Anglo American plc Approved Pension Scheme (formerly known as the Minorco Executive Directors'
Fund). This scheme is also a defined contribution pension scheme. Prior to the formation of the Company in May 1999, A W Lea
was entitled to employer contributions at a rate of 35% of the basic salary under his contract with Anglo American International
(BVI) Limited, a commitment which continues to be honoured. A W Lea is also entitled to deferred benefits in the Pension Fund in
respect of previous South African service.
B E Davison participates in the International Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited; normal
contributions are made on his behalf at the rate of 25% of the basic salary payable under this contract. He also participates in the
Anglo American Corporation Retirement Fund, whereby contributions are made at the rate of 15% of basic salary (plus car allowance
for historical reasons), under his South African contract. He elected to join this scheme when it was established in September 1998
and transferred his accrued benefits from the Pension Fund, of which he was previously a member.
W A Nairn participated until his retirement at 31 December 2004 in the International Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo
American International (IOM) Limited; normal contributions were made on his behalf at the rate of 25% of the basic salary payable
under this contract. He was also entitled to contributions at the rate of 14% of basic salary (plus car allowance for historical
reasons) to an independent personal retirement plan located in South Africa, under his South African contract. 
No pension costs were incurred in respect of the non-executive directors, with the exception of R M Godsell, who continued to be a
member of the AngloGold Ashanti Pension Fund (a defined benefit pension scheme) in his capacity as chief executive of that company.

Defined contribution pension schemes
The amounts paid into defined contribution pension schemes by the Group in respect of the individual directors were as follows:
Normal contributions

A J Trahar 156 142
B E Davison 97 90
A W Lea 179 166
W A Nairn 89 81
(1)
As Messrs Trahar, Davison and Nairn have no provision for past service in respect of their sterling-denominated pension fund, their employing company has contractually agreed that supplementary
pension contributions should be made to the International Scheme in return for these executives having given up their right to part of their future basic salary. These supplementary contributions,
of  89,000 (2003:  81,000),  47,000 (2003:  43,000) and  42,000 (2003:  38,000) respectively, are disclosed in the directors' emoluments table on page 35.
Defined benefit pension schemes
A J Trahar and A W Lea are eligible for membership of the Pension Fund in respect of their South African remuneration (or, in the
case of A W Lea, his past service in South Africa). The Pension Fund is a funded final salary occupational pension scheme approved
by the Financial Services Board and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in South Africa.

and  171,000 respectively. 
(2)
The increase in transfer value above 2003's figure arises from currency differences, salary increases and, in the case of A J Trahar, 12 months' additional pensionable service. 
(3)
In his capacity as chief executive of AngloGold Ashanti, R M Godsell is entitled to membership of the AngloGold Ashanti Pension Fund.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director; instead, they represent
potential liabilities of the pension schemes.
7. Excess retirement benefits
No person who served as a director of the Company during or before 2004 has been paid or received retirement benefits in excess
of the retirement benefits to which he was entitled on the date on which benefits first became payable (or 31 March 1997,
whichever is later).
8. Sums paid to third parties in respect of a director's services
No consideration was paid to or became receivable by third parties for making available the services of any person: as a director 
of the Company, or while a director of the Company, as a director of any of the Company's subsidiary undertakings, or as a director
of any other undertaking of which he was (while a director of the Company) a director by virtue of the Company's nomination, 
or otherwise in connection with the management of the Company or any undertaking during the year to 31 December 2004.

INDEPENDENT REMUNERATION REPORT REVIEW
This letter reports on the results of the review carried out by Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited of the processes followed
by the Anglo American Remuneration Committee (the Committee) that support the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2004.
Mercer undertook the review at the request of the chairman of the Committee in order to provide shareholders with assurance
that the remuneration processes followed are appropriate and that the Committee has complied with the policies set out in the
Remuneration Report.
In order to reach our opinion, we reviewed the Committee's Terms of Reference and the minutes of its meetings held during 
the year as well as material presented to the Committee for its review. We also interviewed the chairman and secretary of 
the Committee. Our review was not intended to audit the compensation data set forth in the Remuneration Report or to evaluate
the merits of Anglo American's remuneration programme.
Based on our review, Mercer is of the opinion that the process followed by the Committee during 2004 was fully consistent with
its Terms of Reference and that the decisions taken by the Committee were in line with the principles set out in the Remuneration
Report. It continues to be our view that the Committee takes a suitably robust approach to its work. We would note in particular
the changes to long term incentive arrangements which have been proposed in response to dialogue held with institutional
investors.
We note that the Committee has refined its modus operandi each year, taking into account any comments we have made in our
reviews. As a result, we believe that the Anglo American Remuneration Committee is exemplary in its conduct, decision-making
and reporting. 
The members of the Remuneration Committee have received training and are regularly updated on executive compensation 
and corporate governance matters.
Further detail regarding the Mercer review is included in a letter of this date addressed to the Committee chairman, which we
understand will be made available on the Company's website.
