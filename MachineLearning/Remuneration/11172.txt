 THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Role of the Remuneration Committee and Terms of Reference
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible for considering and making recommendations to the board on: 
>the Company's general policy on executive and senior management remuneration; 
> the specific remuneration packages for executive directors of the Company including, but not limited to, basic salary, performance-based
short and long term incentives, pensions, and other benefits; and
> the operation of the Company's share incentive schemes.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee included the following non-executive directors during the year ended 31 December 2002: 
>R J Margetts (chairman);
>D J Challen (appointed on 9 September 2002);
> Dr C E Fay; 
>F T M Phaswana (appointed on 12 June 2002);
> Sir David Scholey (resigned on 19 July 2002); and
>P S Wilmot-Sitwell (retired on 10 May 2002).
The Committee met five times during 2002. The Company chairman and the chief executive attend the Committee meetings and assist the
Committee in its considerations, except when issues relating to their own compensation are discussed. No director is involved in deciding
his own remuneration. In 2002 the Committee was advised by R J King and C B Corrin (Group human resources), the Company's finance
function and the following external advisors:
> Andersen - appointed by the Company with the agreement of the Committee in January 2001 to advise on executive remuneration 
and assist with the implementation of employee share plans. Andersen ceased to exist with effect from 31 July 2002, and accordingly
did not provide advice after this date;
> Ernst & Young LLP - appointed by the Committee in September 2002 as independent advisors to the Committee on compliance with
the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002;
> Monks Partnership (a subsidiary of PricewaterhouseCoopers) - appointed by the Company with the agreement of the Committee 
to provide market remuneration information throughout the year; and
>Towers Perrin UK - appointed by the Company with the agreement of the Committee in October 2002 to provide market remuneration
information.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting UK (Mercer) is engaged by the Committee to review the Company's Remuneration Committee 
processes on an annual basis in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes that the Company and 
the Committee have followed are in line with stated policy as set out below, and that the Committee has operated within its Terms 
of Reference. A summary of the letter from Mercer containing the conclusions of their review of the Company's executive remuneration
processes for 2002 can be found on page 27, whilst the full letter can be found on the Company's website.
In 2002 the advisors to the Remuneration Committee provided other services to the Company in the UK on the following basis:
Advisors Nature of other services
Andersen Advice on the cost and sourcing of share schemes
Ernst & Young LLP General tax advice
PricewaterhouseCoopers Taxation and payroll advice; investment advisors, administrators and actuaries

REMUNERATION REPORT REMUNERATION POLICY
Principles of executive remuneration
Anglo American's remuneration policy is formulated to attract and
retain high calibre executives and motivate them to develop and
implement the Company's business strategy in order to optimise 
long term shareholder value creation. It is the intention that this
policy should conform to best practice standards and that it will
apply for 2003 and subsequent years, subject to ongoing review as
appropriate. The policy is framed around the following key principles:
> total rewards will be set at levels that are competitive within 
the relevant market;
> total incentive-based rewards will be earned through the
achievement of demanding performance conditions consistent 
with shareholder interests over the short, medium and long term;
> incentive plans, performance measures, and targets will be
structured to operate soundly throughout the business cycle; and
> the design of long term incentives is prudent and does not expose
shareholders to unreasonable financial risk. 
During the year the Committee chairman, and C B Corrin acting on his
behalf, have consulted with representatives of the principal investors
in the Company on a variety of issues relating to this policy.
Elements of executive director remuneration
Executive director remuneration comprises the following five 
principal elements:
> base salary;
> annual bonus plan;
> share option scheme;
> long term incentive plan (LTIP); and
> benefits. 
The Committee seeks to ensure an appropriate balance between 
the fixed and performance-related elements of executive director
remuneration, and between those aspects of the package linked 
to short term financial performance and those linked to longer term
shareholder value creation. It is intended that, assuming on target
performance, around 50% (around 60% for the CEO) or more of
executive director remuneration is performance related. The Committee
considers each element of remuneration relative to the market and
takes into account the performance of the Company and the individual
executive director in recommending quantum and design. 
The policy relating to each component of remuneration is
summarised below:
Base salary
The base salary of the executive directors is subject to annual review
and is set to be competitive at the median level with reference to
external market practice in similar companies, based in the UK and
overseas, which are comparable in terms of size, market sector,
business complexity and international scope. Company performance,
individual performance and changes in responsibilities are also taken
into consideration when determining annual base salaries.
Annual bonus plan
All executive directors are eligible to participate in an annual bonus
plan, with payment levels based on corporate and individual
performance. Bonus potentials are set on an individual basis and 
in the light of market movement and for the last year were capped 
at 70% of base salary for the chief executive, 60% for B E Davison
and 50% for other directors. The bonus plan is not pensionable.
The Committee retains the discretion to make adjustments to
bonuses earned at the end of the year on an exceptional basis,
taking into account both Company performance and the overall and
specific contribution of individual executives to the Company's
success. This discretion was not used this year. Similarly, the level
of bonuses payable is reduced if certain overall safety improvement
targets are not met, and some reduction did apply this year.
The performance measures for the annual bonus plan include
measures of corporate (and, where applicable, business)
performance as well as the achievement of specific individual
objectives. The corporate element is based upon stretching Earnings
Per Share (EPS) targets. EPS is calculated in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 14, using the headline earnings
measure, the definition of which can be found on page 44. The
Committee reviews measures annually, after consultation with the
chairman and chief executive, to ensure that the measures and
targets set are appropriate given the economic context and the
performance expectations for the Company and its operating
businesses. It is the Committee's usual policy to base 70% of each
annual bonus award on the corporate or business measure and the
remaining 30% on the personal key performance measures.
In order to encourage directors to build up a significant personal 
stake in the Company, a share match is used. Directors are required
to defer 50% of their bonus and may, at the discretion of the
Committee on a year-by-year basis, defer all of their bonus (net of
tax) to acquire shares in Anglo American. If these shares are held for
three years they will be matched by the Company on a one-for-one
basis conditional upon the executive director's continued employment.
Use of this share match has allowed Anglo American to maintain
competitiveness in annual bonus plan levels, encouraging executives
to invest in the shares of the Company and thus increasing the
proportion of executive director rewards linked to both short term
performance and longer term total shareholder returns. The bonus
deferral and share match also acts as a retention tool, and ensures
that executive directors share a significant level of personal exposure
to the Company's share performance.
Share option scheme
The Committee's policy is to make annual grants of share options 
to executive directors up to a maximum of one times' annual
remuneration for all directors except for the chief executive, to whom
the Committee's policy is to make annual grants of share options with
a market value of up to one and a quarter times' annual remuneration.
In exceptional circumstances these maximum grant levels may be
increased at the Committee's discretion. All share options are granted
at market value at the time of grant.
Options are granted as Inland Revenue approved (Approved Options)
and unapproved options (Unapproved Options). The exercise of the
options is subject to Anglo American's EPS (calculated in accordance
with FRS 14, based on the Company's headline earnings measure)
increasing by at least 6% above the UK Retail Price Index over a
three year period. EPS was selected as the key performance measure
for this plan as it is a fundamental financial performance indicator,
both internally and externally. The EPS growth requirement takes
account of the cyclical nature of the natural resources business. 
If the performance condition is not met at the end of the first three
year period, then performance is retested each year over the ten
year life of the option on a rolling three year basis. Options are
normally exercisable, subject to satisfaction of the performance
condition, between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Executive directors are also eligible to participate in the Company's
Save As You Earn (SAYE) and Share Incentive Plan (SIP) schemes,
which are open to all UK employees.

Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
It is the Committee's policy to make conditional LTIP awards to executive directors annually. These awards are discretionary and are
considered on a case-by-case basis. The policy of the Committee at present, and in recent years, is to make annual awards of LTIP interests
over shares with a face value of 120% of basic salary for the chief executive and 100% of basic salary for the other executive directors.
However, in exceptional circumstances and in order to accommodate changing market conditions, awards may be made to each executive
director of up to a maximum of two times' basic salary per annum.
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to the achievement of stretching performance measures relating to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and 
to an operating measure, initially Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), over a fixed three year period. 50% of the award for all directors,
except B E Davison, is subject to the Group TSR measure and 50% to a Group ROCE measure. Vesting of B E Davison's award is conditional
upon the same TSR performance measure; however, only 30% of the award is conditional upon the Group ROCE measure, with the balance
of 20% of the award being conditional upon an Anglo American Platinum Corporation Limited (Anglo Platinum) ROCE measure. This reflects
his responsibility for the Anglo Platinum business. These performance conditions are selected on the basis that they clearly foster the
creation of shareholder value, and there is no provision for retesting.
The Committee may amend the performance condition applying to any award, provided that the amended conditions are no less demanding
and will be a fairer measure of performance or will provide a more effective incentive to the participant, and that circumstances merit such
a change. At the end of each performance period, the level of performance achieved and the level of award earned will be published and 
be subject to external verification by the Company's auditors.
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executive directors by rewarding superior shareholder and financial performance 
and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in Anglo American. 
Detailed structure of the LTIP
Part of each award will be based on the TSR measure and part will be based on the operating measure, as described below:

Further details of the TSR and ROCE operating measures are set out below
Total Shareholder Return
The proportion of shares vesting in relation to the part of the award contingent on TSR performance varies according to the Company's TSR
over the performance period relative to a weighted basket of international natural resource companies (the  Index'). The Index comprises
three categories, and each of the three categories is weighted to reflect Anglo American's business mix, and the average TSR of the Index
is thus determined. The first category consists of a minimum of five international diversified mining companies, the second of a minimum
of five international forest products companies and the third a minimum of four international industrial minerals companies. The Committee
may amend the list of comparator companies in the Index, and the relative weightings, if circumstances make this necessary (for example,
as a result of takeovers or mergers of comparator companies in the Index). In calculating TSR, it is assumed that all dividends are
reinvested.
For the LTIP interests awarded in 2002 the comparator companies are as follows:
Mining Forest Products Industrial Minerals
Category weighting 71% 17% 12%
Comparator companies Anglovaal Mining Limited M-real Corporation Aggregate Industries plc
BHP Billiton plc Sappi Limited CRH plc
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce SCA Hanson plc

Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between 50% and 100% as described above, and also between 100% and 150%
for exceptional performance as described above.
A graph showing Anglo American's TSR performance against the weighted average of the comparator index as shown above for the period
from 24 May 1999, when the Company was incorporated, to 31 December 2002 can be found on page 20; for the purposes of drawing
this graph Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and Xstrata plc were excluded from the index as they were not listed at the beginning of the period
depicted by the graph.
Return On Capital Employed 
ROCE has been adopted as the second performance measure for the LTIP grants made to date. The directors consider this to be among the
most important factors which drive sustainable improvements in shareholder value in a natural resources business as well as one of the
most important measures of differentiation in performance in this sector.
The proportion of shares vesting in relation to this part of the award will vary according to the degree of improvement in the Group's and/or
business' average annualised ROCE over the performance period (adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange
rate effects and for relevant changes in the composition of the Group).
The Committee has set Minimum Targets for improvement in return on both capital employed for the financial year preceding the start 
of the performance period (Existing Capital Employed) and on the additional capital employed during the performance period (Incremental
Capital Employed). The Maximum ROCE Targets are based on stretching levels of return on the Existing Capital Employed. 
The targets for each element of the 2002 Plan are shown below. These are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign
exchange rate effects and for relevant changes in the composition of the Group.

Pensions
Pension and life insurance benefits for executive directors reflect practice in the countries in which they perform their principal duties.
Pension arrangements are tailored to take account of historical obligations and, insofar as agreed by the Committee, the personal
circumstances of each executive. Details of individual pension arrangements are set out on pages 24 and 25.
Other benefits
Executive directors are entitled to the provision of either a car allowance or a fully expensed car, medical insurance, death and disability
insurance, social club membership (in accordance with local market practice) and reimbursement of reasonable business expenses. Directors
based in South Africa are eligible to receive housing loan subsidies at a preferential interest rate in accordance with local market practice.
The provision of these benefits is considered to be market competitive in the appropriate locality for executive director positions.
Executive shareholding targets
Within five years of their appointment, executive directors are expected to acquire a holding of shares with a value of one and a half times'
base salary in the case of the chief executive, and one times' base salary in the case of other executive directors.
Share dilution through the operation of share plans
Where shares are issued to satisfy incentives, the aggregate dilution resulting from executive incentives will not exceed 5% in any ten-year
period, and that resulting from all incentives, including all-employee incentives, will not exceed 10% in any ten-year period.
External appointments
Executive directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices without the approval of the board; if approved, they may
retain the fees payable from one such appointment.

Non-executive directors
The board reviews non-executive directors' fees periodically in the light of fees payable to non-executive directors for comparable
companies and the importance attached to the retention and attraction of high calibre individuals as non-executive directors. Levels of fees
are also set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the board and its committees. Additional fees 
are paid to the senior independent non-executive director and were also paid to the deputy chairman while the post was occupied. Where
non-executive directors have board roles within subsidiaries of the Company, then they also receive additional fees on account of their
increased responsibilities.
Non-executive directors are eligible to forgo all or part of their directors' fees to subscribe for shares in the Company, after deduction 
of applicable income tax and social security contributions. The non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's annual bonus
plan, share option schemes, long term incentive plan or Company pension arrangements.
Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that the period of notice required for executive directors does not exceed 12 months. 
In order to properly reflect their spread of responsibilities, all the executive directors, with the exception of A W Lea, who is employed 
by Anglo American International (BVI) Limited, have contracts with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited and with Anglo Operations
Limited. The salaries under these contracts are payable in sterling and/or South African rand as appropriate. The employment contracts 
of all executive directors are terminable at 12 months' notice by either party. 
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with Anglo American for an initial period of three years from their date of appointment,
subject to reappointment at the annual general meeting. In addition to his service contract with Anglo American, R M Godsell has a service
contract with AngloGold Limited, an independently managed subsidiary of Anglo American, in his capacity as chief executive. Under this
contract, his employment may be terminated by either party giving to the other 12 months' notice.

At each annual general meeting (AGM) all those directors who have been in office for three years or more since their election or last 
re-election shall retire from office. Sir David Scholey retires by rotation at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offers himself for 
re-election. In addition, a director may at any annual general meeting retire from office and stand for re-election. Sir Mark Moody-Stuart,
D J Challen and F T M Phaswana were appointed subsequent to the 2002 AGM and will stand for election at the 2003 AGM.
(2)
There is no fixed notice period; however, the Company may in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of the Companies Act
1985, by Ordinary Resolution, of which special notice has been given, remove any director from office. 
The contracts of executive directors contain a provision that sets out the compensation payable in lieu of notice if the Company terminates
the contract (other than for cause) or the executive resigns in circumstances where there has been a material adverse change in role,
responsibilities or remuneration. Compensation is based on the value of 12 months' basic salary, target annual bonus for 12 months and
the annual value of benefits. The Company may choose whether to continue to provide other benefits per se during the notice period or 
to pay an amount equal to the gross value of these benefits over the period. 
Vesting of share options on termination of a director's contract is dependent on how the contract is terminated. Performance conditions 
fall away in the event of redundancy. However, if the director resigns voluntarily, then all options lapse unless the Committee determines
otherwise. In the case of LTIP interests, if a director resigns, then his interests lapse. If he is made redundant, at the end of the
performance period vesting is based on the normal performance criteria and then is pro-rated for the proportion of the performance period
for which the director served. Similarly, in the case of the deferred bonus plan, no matching shares would be granted should a director
resign before the end of the three year vesting period, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise. If a director is made
redundant, he would receive matching shares pro-rated for the proportion of the vesting period for which he served.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2002 Performance graphs
The graphs below represent the comparative TSR performance of the Company from 24 May 1999 to 31 December 2002.
This first graph shows the Company's performance against the performance of the FTSE 100 Index, chosen as being a broad equity market
index consisting of companies of comparable size and complexity to Anglo American. This graph has been produced in accordance with the
requirements of the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The second graph shows the Company's performance against the weighted comparator group used to measure company performance for the
purposes of the vesting of LTIP interests granted in 2002. This graph gives an indication of how Anglo American is performing against the
targets in place for LTIP interests already granted, although the specifics of the comparator companies for each year's interests may vary 
to reflect changes in the marketplace such as mergers and acquisitions amongst the Company's competitors or changes to the Company's
business mix.
In drawing these graphs it has been assumed that all dividends paid have been reinvested. The TSR level shown at 31 December each year
is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the 30 day period up to and including that date.
REMUNERATION OUTCOMES DURING 2002
The application of the Company's remuneration policy during the period under review resulted in the following directors' remuneration. In
compiling this report, the Committee has taken into account the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, as well as the provisions

Details of the share option scheme and the performance conditions attached to awards of share options can be found on page 16.
In summary, the exercise of these options is subject to Anglo American's EPS increasing by at least 6% above the UK Retail Price Index
over a three-year period.

The Anglo American options awarded in March 2002 in respect of the Executive Share Option Scheme were granted at an exercise 
price of  11.50, which reflected the price ruling at the date of grant. These share options are exercisable between 18 March 2005 
and 17 March 2012. The directors have also been granted additional shares in order to meet the national insurance contribution
liability. The directors do not benefit from this arrangement which operates as a hedge against the future uncapped national insurance
contributions liability and hence these have not been included herein. In addition, W A Nairn was granted 1,029 shares under the 
SAYE Scheme at an exercise price of  9.23.

The LTIP award made in 2002 is conditional on two performance conditions: the first based on Anglo American's TSR relative to a
weighted group of international natural resource companies, and the second based on an underlying operating measure which focuses 
on raising Anglo American's/Anglo Platinum's ROCE in the medium term. Further details on the structure of the LTIP, the required level 
of performance for the 2002 award and how performance against targets is tested can be found on pages 17 and 18. The market price 
of the shares at the date of award was  11.20.
(2)
The executive directors have also been granted additional unconditional shares in order to meet the national insurance contribution
liability on both the TSR and operating measure elements of awards under the LTIP. The executive directors do not benefit from such 
an arrangement, which operates as a hedge against the future uncapped national insurance contributions liability, and hence these 
shares have not been included herein.

Directors' pension arrangements
Each executive director, other than A W Lea, is a member of the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme, which is 
a defined contribution pension scheme.
A J Trahar is a member of the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme, and under his contract with Anglo American
International (IOM) Limited contributions are made on his behalf at the rate of 35% of base salary payable under this contract. He is also
a member of the Anglo American Corporation Pension Fund, under which he accrues benefits at the rate of 2.2% per annum of pensionable salary
(as defined in the rules of that scheme) under his South African contract for each year of pensionable service. The scheme provides spouses'
benefits of two-thirds of the member's pension on the death of a member. It does not have provision for guaranteed pension increases.
A W Lea is a member of the Anglo American plc Approved Pension Scheme (formerly known as the Minorco Executive Directors' Fund). 
This scheme is also a defined contribution pension scheme. Prior to the formation of the Company in May 1999, A W Lea was entitled to
company contributions at a rate of 35% of base salary under his contract with Anglo American International (BVI) Limited, a commitment
which continues to be honoured. A W Lea is entitled to deferred benefits in the Anglo American Corporation Pension Fund in respect of
previous South African service.
B E Davison is a member of the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme, and under his contract with Anglo American
International (IOM) Limited contributions are made on his behalf at the rate of 25% of base salary. He is also a member of the Anglo
American Corporation Retirement Fund, contributions to which are made at the rate of 15% of base salary (plus car allowance) under his
South African employment contract. He elected to join this scheme when it was established in September 1998 and has transferred his
accrued benefits from the Anglo American Corporation Pension Fund, of which he was previously a member.
W A Nairn is a member of the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme, and under his contract with Anglo American
International (IOM) Limited contributions are made on his behalf at the rate of 25% of base salary. He is also entitled to contributions at
the rate of 15% of base salary (plus car allowance) to an independent personal pension plan located in South Africa under his employment
contract with Anglo Operations Limited. 
No pension costs were incurred in respect of the non-executive directors, save in respect of J Ogilvie Thompson (see below) and 
R M Godsell, who continued to be a member of the AngloGold Pension Fund (a defined benefit pension scheme) in his capacity as chief
executive of that company.

REMUNERATION REPORT REVIEW
This letter reports on the results of the review by Mercer Human Resource Consulting of the executive remuneration processes and
outcomes that underlie Anglo American's remuneration report for the financial year 2002. Mercer undertook the review at the request of
the Company's Remuneration Committee (the Committee) in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes
that you have followed are appropriate and that the Company has complied with the policies set out in the remuneration report.
In order to reach our opinion, we reviewed the Remuneration Committee's Terms of Reference and the minutes of its meetings during the
year as well as the materials prepared for the Committee's review. We also interviewed the Committee Chairman and Secretary. Our review
was not intended to audit the compensation data set forth in the remuneration report or to evaluate the merits of Anglo American's
executive remuneration programme.
Based on our review, Mercer is of the opinion that Anglo American's executive remuneration process with respect to 2002 was fully
consistent with the description set forth in the remuneration report and that the remuneration decisions for the year were made based on
the principles and policies laid out in the report. Furthermore, it is our view that the Remuneration Committee continues to take a suitably
robust approach to its work. One area of potential improvement that we identified was that of ensuring that effective training procedures
are put in place for new appointments to the Committee. Management have undertaken to do this.
Additional detail regarding Mercer's review is included in a letter of this date to the Committee Chairman; we understand that this letter 
will be available on the Company's website.
