Remuneration policy and structure 
The Committee is responsible for remuneration policies that are consistent with the Group's overall business strategy and thereby attract 
and retain high calibre executives at the same time as delivering value for shareholders. Remuneration includes both fixed and variable 
elements of pay, variable pay being clearly linked to superior performance. The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and 
variable performance based pay for each Executive Director based on the maximum entitlements.

Each of the above components is discussed in greater detail in the following sections of this report. The sections dealing with Directors' 
emoluments paid, pensions and incentives have been audited.
Fixed elements of pay
Base salary
The Committee reviews base salaries for each Executive Director and senior executives annually taking into account the responsibilities and 
performance of the individual, current market practice, pay in similar engineering businesses and companies of a comparable size and scale 
of operations. The Committee was also mindful of pay levels amongst the employee population.
The Executive Directors received inflationary salary increases for 2012 and 2013. The salaries of the Executive Directors are as follows:
Name Position Salary from 1 January 2012 Salary from 1 January 2013
S.C. Harris Group Chief Executive  457 ,800  470,200
D.F . Landless Group Finance Director  292,400  300,300
Pension
The Committee reviews the pension arrangements for the Executive Directors to ensure that the benefits provided are consistent with 
those provided by other similar companies. 
Mr Harris is entitled to a salary supplement in lieu of pension at a rate of 22% of basic salary, of which  82,000 was waived during the year. 
In addition, in the event of death, a death in service benefit of eight times basic salary will become payable. 
From April 2012 Mr Landless ceased to participate in the Group's UK contributory defined benefit pension scheme due to him prospectively 
reaching the lifetime limit. Instead Mr Landless receives a salary supplement of 22% of basic salary up to the defined benefit scheme cap 
and 16% of base salary above the cap, of which  35,000 was waived during the year.
The defined benefit scheme is closed to new members and provides increases in pensionable salary capped at 3% per annum. The scheme 
also provides lump sum death-in-service benefits and pension benefits based on final pensionable salary. For Mr Landless death in service 
under the defined benefit scheme changed when he ceased to be a contributory member of the defined benefit scheme from four times 
basic salary with spousal pension to eight time's basic salary without spousal pension.
An analysis of the accrued pension entitlements for Mr Landless under the defined benefit pension scheme during 2012 is given on page 51 .
Variable elements of pay
Clawback policy
During the year the Committee introduced a formal clawback policy for Executive Directors in respect of annual bonuses and long-term 
incentive awards. This clawback policy is to come into effect from 1 January 2013 and has been introduced to provide the Committee with 
discretionary powers to clawback performance based remuneration should exceptional circumstances occur. Such circumstances would 
include:
 Fraud;
 Misconduct;
 Significant misstatement of financial results; or
 Miscalculation of performance conditions. 
Should the Committee, in its opinion, consider such circumstances to have occurred during a performance period from 2013 onwards then 
the clawback policy will provide the Committee discretion to determine that any amounts paid or awards vested by reference to the relevant  48 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
period shall be clawed back. Clawback will start to apply to awards made from 2013 and the Committee expects that the mechanism 
to clawback any such amounts will be to reduce future annual bonus payments, reduce the value of subsisting awards that have, at the 
relevant time, not yet vested or by reducing the level of award to be made at the following grant date.
Annual bonuses
The annual bonus provides the Executive Directors and other senior executives with the opportunity to receive an annual bonus wholly 
payable in cash based on achievement of certain performance targets. Recognising that despite an increase, the Group Chief Executive 
remained behind many of his peers in terms of base salary in 2011, the maximum annual bonus opportunity for the Group Chief Executive 
was increased to 130% of base salary to ensure comparability in terms of total reward on achievement of superior performance. The 
structure of the annual bonus scheme in 2012 for Executive Directors was as follows:
Maximum Profit Cash flow Personal objectives Actual
% salary % weight % achieved % weight % achieved % weight % achieved % salary
S.C. Harris 130 70 48 10 10 20 15 95
D.F . Landless 100 70 48 10 10 20 15 73
The Committee also has discretion to reduce the awards by up to 10% if the safety performance is less than targeted.
For 2013 the Committee has determined that the bonus opportunity for Executive Directors and senior executives will again be contingent 
on meeting targets relating to safety, operating profit, cash management and personal objectives. No bonus will be paid for the cash 
management element unless the level of operating profit achieved is at least 95% of target. The target is based on budget exchange rates 
and acquisitions are excluded. In addition, future annual bonus payments will be subject to the Committee's clawback policy as outlined 
previously.
Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP)
The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares up 
to a maximum of 175% of base salary. Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period.
50% of the award is subject to a return on capital employed (ROCE) performance condition and 50% of the award is subject to an earnings 
per share (EPS) performance condition. The Committee, in determining the performance targets attached to awards, takes into account the 
current and forecasted performance for the business and its sector along with broker consensus to ensure stretch targets are set.
ROCE EPS
Award year Threshold performance Maximum performance Threshold performance Maximum performance 
2010 11 .1% 16% 19.8p 31 .0p
2011 14.6% 20% 28.3p 39.8p
2012 18.7% 23% 36.2p 62.15p
2013 18.7% 23% 42.0

p61.3

p
1 The 2012 EPS targets restated at exchange rates on 31 December 2012 correspond to 33.8p at threshold and 58.08p at maximum performance with the result that 2013 targets in real 
terms are ahead of those for 2012. 
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest. Regardless of 
ROCE performance, should EPS at the end of the performance period be below 16p for any BIP awards made between 2010 and 2011, 
below 31 .1p for awards made in 2012 and below 42p for awards made in 2013, then no award shall vest. Awards commence vesting 
progressively from zero on achievement of threshold performance with maximum performance resulting in awards vesting in full. In 
addition, the 2013 and future BIP awards will be subject to the Committee's clawback policy as outlined previously.
The Committee has decided that the ROCE figure of 23% is a good aspiration for the Group and are cognisant of the fact that overdriving 
incentives on capital employed can lead to unintended consequences in terms of short term capital starvation for the business.
The Committee intends to use the ROCE and EPS measures in combination for BIP Awards made in 2013. Details of the awards made 
under the BIP are provided on page 50. Following completion of the performance period the Remuneration Committee has determined 
that 175% of the BIP awards made in 2010 shall vest (2009: 175%) as the level of ROCE and EPS performance was 87 .5% and 87 .5% 
respectively. In reaching this conclusion, the Remuneration Committee took into account certain review procedures carried out by the 
external auditor.
Bodycote Co-investment Plan (CIP)
The CIP provides a link between the Company's short and long-term incentive arrangements and permits executives to invest in shares 
up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary. The CIP provides for the grant of awards of matching shares to participants on an 
annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred shares. Deferred shares must be held for three years 
and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target. The threshold target for CIP matching awards is TSR 
growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) for a threshold matching ratio of 
1:2. 10% per annum compound growth in excess of growth in the CPI will be required for a vesting matching ratio of 1:1 . In addition, the 
2013 and future CIP awards will be subject to the Committee's clawback policy as outlined previously.
As the performance period for the 2010 CIP award commenced on 1 May 2010 and ends on 30 April 2013, the outcome will be reported in 
next year's report.

Advisors
During the year the Committee has taken independent advice from Ernst & Young LLP on remuneration together with legal advice from 
Eversheds. Fees relating to the Ernst & Young LLP services were  70,000, which included amongst other things, benchmarking of 
executive salaries, advice relating to the vesting of awards made under the Bodycote Incentive Plan both in the UK and overseas and advice 
regarding the proposed changes to the reporting of remuneration by the Department for Business Innovation & Skills. Ernst & Young LLP 
also advises the Company on tax matters and provides the internal audit service. Other fees included  2,000 paid to Eversheds in respect 
of Remuneration Committee advice.
T otal Shareholder Return
The graph on page 51 illustrates the Company's TSR performance since 2007 relative to the FTSE All Share Industrial Index of which the 
Company is a component part. This sector is considered the most appropriate comparator group over the five-year period to 31 December 
2012. In line with market practice the calculation for TSR assumes reinvestment of dividends and is based on data provided by Datastream.
Service contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period. All the Executive Directors have 
service agreements which are terminable by one year's notice by the employer at any time, and by payment of one year's remuneration in 
lieu of notice by the employer. One year's remuneration does not include any BIP or CIP payments (which would be subject to the normal 
leaver provisions) or, by default, payment of any projected bonuses, instead any bonus payment due will be calculated by reference to the 
average of the previous three years. With the exception of David Landless, the Executive Directors do not have a change of control clause. 
David Landless' service contract was agreed in accordance with what was considered best practice at the time of its execution in 2001 
and provides for one year's remuneration on a change of control if his employment is terminated. To the extent that executive contracts are 
renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy of best practice when entering into service contracts. 
In any case legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual 
incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of any Executive Director, other than payments made on a 
change in control or for payments in lieu of notice. Mr Harris' service agreement is dated 6 October 2008 and Mr Landless' contract is 
dated 26 September 2001 .
Long-term savings vehicle
During the financial year the Company made discretionary contributions into the Bodycote Investment Incentive Plan. The plan is entirely 
cash based to provide an alternative long-term savings vehicle for senior executives. The Committee considers the plan an essential tool 
to aid retention while recognising the need for executives to have flexibility in long-term financial planning. Company contributions are 
discretionary and vary year on year and are made in lieu of other elements of pay and therefore the Company remains cost neutral and any 
risk in relation to the value of investments made in the plan is borne entirely by participants. Contributions for the Executive Directors are 
shown on page 51 .
Shareholding policy
In 2005, the Committee introduced a shareholding retention policy under which Executive Directors and other senior executives are 
expected, within five years of that date or commencement of employment if later, to build up a shareholding in the Company. In respect 
of Executive Directors the expectation is to hold at least 100% of basic salary. As at 31 December 2012, the Committee is satisfied that 
Executive Directors have fulfilled this requirement.
Fees retained for external Non-Executive Directorships
Executive Directors may hold positions in other companies as Non-Executive Directors. Stephen Harris was the only Executive Director with 
such a position held at Mondi plc from 1 March 2011 and in accordance with Group policy he retained fees for the year of  77 ,765.
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for the Chairman 
is determined by the whole Board (excluding the Chairman). Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors takes into 
account the time commitments and duties and responsibilities involved. The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director hold letters of 
appointment which have been agreed in accordance with best practice which set out the terms of their appointment, including membership 
of Board committees, the fees to be paid and the time commitment expected from the Director. The letter also covers such matters as 
the confidentiality of information and Bodycote's share dealing code. During 2011 the letters of appointment for the Chairman and each 
Non-Executive Director were renewed, each for a period of no longer than three years. Each is terminable under the Company's Articles 
of Association, the Act, by the Director's resignation or otherwise on six months' notice if termination occurs before expiry of the term. To 
determine the fees it pays to Non-Executive Directors, the Board takes into account the need to attract individuals of appropriate calibre and 
expertise, the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors by other companies of a similar size and scale of operations and the time commitment 
attached to each appointment. The Board keeps fees under review. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any 
pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.
