Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration
Introduction
The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors' Remuneration (the Committee ) 
within a framework set by the Board. As at the date of this report, the Committee's members are three non-executive directors, Mr Toms 
(Chairman), Mr Johnson and Mr Cuthbert. None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the 
matters to be decided. There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on the Company's website www.bellway.co.uk.
During the year, the Group Company Secretary attended a number of Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee and provided advice 
on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration. The Committee also received independent external advice from Hewitt New Bridge 
Street (HNBS ). HNBS was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other services to the Company other than to the Board 
Committee on Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors (apart from the Chairman) is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors' 
Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors. The Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration also receives advice 
from the Group Company Secretary and HNBS.
The Chairman's remuneration is determined by the other non-executive directors.
Context
This year's remuneration report is made at the end of a year which saw significant progress in the management of the business. Profit before tax 
increased from  44.4 million to  67.2 million while debt levels remained extremely low, the Group ending the year with  3.4 million of net cash, 
excluding preference shares. Customer satisfaction levels improved, as did safety performance. Succession to two key Board positions by internal 
management development was also determined. 
The appointment of two new executive directors in the 201 1/12 financial year will provide an opportunity to effect some changes to remuneration 
packages and contracts. Both the new executive directors will start on basic salaries significantly below their predecessors, with a view to upward 
movement as they develop in their roles. Pension contributions will also be significantly lower than the salary supplement in lieu of pension 
contributions which are paid to Mr Watson and Mr Leitch. Both appointments will have new service contract terms reflecting best practice. 
Long-term incentive award levels will remain in line with the previous policy. The Committee, however, has also given further consideration to the 
performance targets and has consulted shareholders on possible changes to these measures. The conclusions are set out in detail in this report.
Objectives
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate 
executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has set, as an objective, a policy of paying remuneration around the median of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses, 
subject to experience and performance, and it is satisfied that the structure of the executives' packages broadly achieves this objective. 
The Committee has used this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the risk of upward only reviews of remuneration. 
The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of remuneration (annual bonus and long-term 
incentive plans (LTIPs )) constitute a significant proportion of an executive's potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if 
demanding and stretching performance targets are achieved. The Committee considers that the remuneration level and structure are fully 
competitive with the market, with a significant element of the package payable in the form of share-based incentives, subject to long-term 
performance conditions.
The structure of the performance conditions for annual bonus and long-term incentives has been designed to provide a strong link to the Company's 
performance, namely a focus on maximising profit in a sustainable fashion and generating superior shareholder returns. This approach generates 
strong alignment of interest between senior executives and shareholders.
To improve the risk profile of the policy and in line with best practice, the Company is introducing a clawback mechanism for bonus and LTIP awards 
in respect of the executive directors and the Group Company Secretary to allow the Company, in exceptional circumstances, to clawback some or 
all of the variable components of that individual's remuneration.
In framing the Company's remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice provisions in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Association of British Insurers' (ABI ) guidance. When determining the elements of remuneration for 
the executive directors, the Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group as a whole, paying 
particular attention to the levels of pay increase awarded to the workforce generally. All employees, including the executive directors, can join the 
Bellway p.l.c. (2003) Savings Related Share Option Scheme (2003 SRSOS ). All employees have access to pension arrangements, most have access 
to life assurance benefits and a significant proportion of employees benefit from health insurance, company car or car allowance. The Committee is 
apprised of any significant policy changes for the workforce generally.

Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration (continued)
Summary of Remuneration Policy
The policy in relation to each component of executive remuneration is described below:
Component Policy Performance period How achieved
Salary To be market competitive. n/a Salary levels set by reference to the mid market level of a 
peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses, taking 
account of individual performance and experience. The 
salaries of the two new executive directors will be positioned 
below the median, with a view to progressing these over 
time as experience is gained.
Benefits To provide a range and 
value which is market 
competitive.
n/a Benefits to be at the mid market level of a peer group of 
similar UK housebuilding businesses, and for existing 
executives include a salary supplement in lieu of pension 
contributions, car or car allowance, life assurance, medical 
cover and permanent health insurance. The policy for new 
executive directors is that their pension contributions will 
be lower than the salary supplement in lieu of pension 
contributions which are paid to Mr Watson and Mr Leitch.
Annual Bonus To reward achievement of 
a combination of financial 
and non-financial 
operational-based 
performance targets.
1 year By providing the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 100% 
of salary (120% for 201 1/12) for outstanding operational 
performance, both financial and non-financial. 
Long-term incentives 
(performance shares and 
matching shares)
To encourage long-term 
value creation, to aid 
retention, to encourage 
shareholding, and to 
promote alignment of 
interest with shareholders.
3 years By using share-based incentives with performance conditions 
which are aligned with shareholders' interests, such as Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR ), which are assessed over a 
three-year period.
Service Contracts and Letters of Appointment
The executive directors have service contracts with a 12-month notice period from the Company and a six-month notice period from the executive. 
For Mr Watson and Mr Leitch, on termination by the Company, an amount equivalent to one year's salary, benefits and the average amount of the 
last two years' annual bonus payments, would be payable. Within six months of a change of control, if either Mr Watson or Mr Leitch serves notice 
to terminate the contract, the liquidated damages payment would be triggered. The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation of 
compensation payable for early termination has ensured that there was variability in the potential level of compensation. In particular, after a period 
of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be payable, reducing potential payout in these circumstances. Mr Watson 
and Mr Leitch have long service with the Company and the Committee has not considered it appropriate to re-negotiate their contracts in relation 
to this provision. 
In accordance with best practice, the service contracts of Mr Ayres, who was appointed to the Board on 1 August 201 1, and Mr Adey, who will be 
appointed to the Board on 1 February 2012, will not provide for the inclusion of average bonus as part of the compensation arrangements in the 
event of early termination and will contain no liquidated damages provision.
The details of the executive directors' service contracts are as follows:

On the expiry of his existing letter of appointment, it is the intention of the Company, following rigorous review, to issue a new letter of appointment 
to Mr Toms for a term of three years from 1 February 2012.
Salaries and Fees
Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year, taking into account the general settlement across the Company. Any changes are implemented from 
that date.
For the year under review, the executive directors received a 2.5% increase in basic salary which reflected the average percentage increase across 
the workforce generally. For 201 1/12, Mr Watson and Mr Leitch have been awarded a 3% increase in basic salary, which will also reflect the average 
percentage increase across the workforce generally.
As previously announced, Mr Stoker retired on 31 July 201 1 and Mr Leitch will retire on 31 January 2012. Mr Ayres was promoted to the Board 
on 1 August 201 1 and Mr Adey will be promoted to the Board on 1 February 2012. The new executive directors' commencing salaries will be 
significantly below those of their predecessors, although it is envisaged that these will be progressively adjusted as they develop and adapt into their 
new roles. Mr Ayres' commencing salary is  250,000.
Fee levels for non-executive directors reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role, including membership or chairmanship of Board 
Committees. Fees are reviewed annually, taking into account the level of fees for similar positions in comparable companies. For the year under 
review, fees were increased by around 6% to reflect the increasing responsibilities, complexity and time commitment of their role. With effect 
from 1 August 201 1 fees have been increased by 3% which is in line with the average percentage increase across the workforce generally. They are 
not entitled to any benefits (with the exception of the Chairman) or pension. They do not participate in any bonus or long-term incentive plan and 
they are not entitled to compensation on termination of their agreements, other than normal notice provisions of three months' notice given by 
either party.
Taxable Benefits
Taxable benefits provided relate to the provision of motor vehicles, telephones and private medical insurance.
Annual Bonus Scheme
For the year under review, bonuses were capped at 100% of basic salary. The performance conditions related to a stretching target range of 
operating profit (80%) and personal performance (20%), with personal performance being assessed by reference to board structure and succession 
planning, land bank management, health and safety and customer care. The Committee considers that the focus of the bonus on the Company's 
primary short-term performance measure of operating profit provides a good link between short-term rewards and its strategy, which is to 
maximise profits sustainably. This also ensures that bonuses are affordable out of profits and there is a consistency with broader employee bonus 
payments. The focus on profitability is balanced by there being a meaningful weighting of the overall bonus on a number of core non-financial 
KPIs (the proportion of which has been increased for 201 1/12) which are considered to have a strong link to profitability and long-term shareholder 
returns.
The performance conditions for the annual bonus are balanced by complementary long-term performance conditions under the Bellway p.l.c. (2004) 
Performance Share Plan (the PSP ), discussed later in this report.
Details of the bonus payments are set out in the notes to the table of directors' emoluments on page 40. Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway shares held in the 
Bellway Employee Share Trust (1992) (the Trust ) under the terms of the Bellway p.l.c. (2008) Share Matching Plan (the SMP ).

Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration (continued)
As explained above, in relation to the two new executive directors joining the Board in the 201 1/12 financial year, the Committee is keen to ensure 
that the total earnings opportunity for individuals should remain sufficient to retain high quality executives and to align their performance to the 
interests of shareholders. As part of this, the Committee has looked again at the maximum achievable annual bonus. Up to 2009, this had been set 
at 120% of salary, with 150% achievable in exceptional circumstances (effectively the maximum limit). In 2009, as the housebuilding sector 
encountered extremely difficult trading conditions, the maximum was reduced to 100%. The management have successfully steered the Company 
through this difficult period and trading conditions have become more stable. Since then a number of other peer housebuilders have raised their 
bonus potential to well in excess of the Bellway level. Following consultation with major shareholders, the Committee intends to return the Bellway 
maximum to 120%, but without the previous provision for 150% in exceptional circumstances. The Committee will ensure that performance targets 
to achieve the maximum will be challenging.
The 201 1/12 bonus will be based on profit (90%) and personal performance targets (30%) with the latter being assessed by reference to land bank 
management, health and safety and customer care. The Committee considers that outperformance of targets in relation to annual profitability and 
non-financial metrics provide a good link to the long-term performance of the business.
Long-term Incentive Plans
The Company operates two LTIPs which are designed to focus executive directors on longer term value creation, provide a strong retentive element 
and alignment of interest with shareholders.
The PSP was introduced for the Company's executive directors and the Group Company Secretary. Under the PSP, executives have been granted 
awards over shares worth 100% of basic salary each year, subject to the achievement of TSR-based performance conditions or, in respect of the 
award granted in January 2008, a combination of TSR and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE ) conditions. Awards will vest to executives after 
three years, subject to the achievement of performance conditions based around TSR. TSR measures the total return (share price growth and 
dividend) on a notional investment in Bellway shares, compared to the return on the same notional investment in shares of the other UK 
housebuilders. Management is rewarded for Bellway's total return outperforming the other UK housebuilders. 
During 2010/1 1 the Committee reviewed the performance conditions in respect of the vesting of future long-term incentive awards. For recent 
awards under the PSP, the TSR performance condition has been based on TSR relative to an index of the larger quoted UK housebuilders. 
The rationale has been that this represents the peer group most directly comparable with the Company. However, it presents two issues. 
Firstly, there are now only six large comparator housebuilders, which means that relative TSR can be volatile, driven by erratic performance by other 
companies in the sector. Secondly, in principle, Bellway has to compete for capital with investment opportunities beyond the housebuilding sector. 
The Committee, after consultation with shareholders, has decided that for awards to be made in 201 1/12, the TSR performance condition will be 
in two parts. Half will be measured by reference to the housebuilders' index as before, and the other half will be measured by reference to the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts and financial services). This change should not make the achievement of the vesting conditions easier, 
or indeed harder, over the long term, but it should make it less erratic. As there are a higher number of comparator companies in the FTSE 250 
comparator group, performance of each company in the group will be assessed and ranked. Awards will start to vest at 25% if Bellway's TSR matches 
the median of the companies in the group, increasing on a straight-line basis so that full vesting would be achieved if Bellway's TSR reaches the upper 
quartile. Grant levels will remain unchanged at 100% of basic salary.
The Committee has also consulted shareholders on the possibility of incorporating additional performance conditions into the PSP for future years 
and this will be considered further as and when appropriate.
TSR is recognised as enabling alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders by providing a reward mechanism for delivering superior stock 
market performance. TSR calculations are independently calculated for the Committee by the Company's brokers.
Further, regardless of TSR performance, for the award to be granted in the 201 1/12 financial year, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest 
unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying financial performance over the performance period, taking into 
account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and Net Asset Value (NAV ). The Committee will scale back the level of vesting 
indicated by the TSR performance condition (potentially to zero) in circumstances where there has not been an improvement. 
The SMP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus. Under the SMP senior executives may invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus, on a 
voluntary basis, in Bellway shares, which must be held for a minimum of three years in the Trust. Invested shares will not be subject to a risk of 
forfeiture and executives will enjoy full beneficial ownership (including voting rights and dividends).
In return for investing in shares under the SMP, an award of matching shares is granted. The level of matching is on a gross basis to the net of tax 
bonus invested in shares.
Matching shares will vest subject to the executive remaining employed, retention of the invested shares and also subject to performance conditions.
No awards have been made to date. For any awards which may be made, the performance conditions will be the same as will apply to the award 
under the PSP in the same period. 
In addition to the two executive plans detailed above, the 2003 SRSOS is available to all employees, including the executive directors.

Other Information Shareholding Guidelines
There is a policy for a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors, equivalent to 100% of basic salary. As at 31 July 201 1, and at 
the date of this report, Mr Watson and Mr Leitch held shares with an equivalent value well in excess of 100% of their basic salary. In response to the 
appointment of Mr Ayres to the Board on 1 August 201 1 the Committee has established the following mechanism to ensure that new executive 
directors acquire the requisite shareholding. Within a period of three months of appointment an executive director must acquire a minimum of 
1,000 ordinary shares in the Company and must retain at least 50% of any shares awarded under the PSP or SMP, after allowance for paying tax, 
until the requisite number of shares has been accumulated. If personal circumstances make this difficult, the Committee would exercise discretion. 
Directors' Interests
The directors' interests (including family interests and holdings in which the directors are interested only as trustees) in the ordinary share capital  
of the Company are set out below:
Fully paid ordinary 12.5 pence shares
Beneficial interests 31 July 2011

P J Stoker (retired 31 July 201 1) 300,000 150,000
A M Leitch 150,000 150,000
There has been no change in any of the above interests between 31 July 201 1 and the date of this report, apart from Mr Ayres, who joined the 
Board on 1 August 201 1, who holds 3,073 ordinary shares in the Company, and Mr Stoker who retired from the Board on 31 July 201 1 and whose 
interests at the date of this report are no longer disclosable.
Pensions
In July 2008 Mr Watson, Mr Stoker and Mr Leitch took enhanced transfer values from the final salary section of the Bellway p.l.c. 1972 Pension 
Scheme, and therefore have no accrued pension entitlements. Since 1 June 2008 they have received a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions 
amounting to 30% of basic salary. Following advice to the Committee, this amount was agreed as being reasonable in the circumstances and was less 
than the annual accrual foregone by the executive directors under the previous final salary arrangements. 
Mr Ayres is a member of the Company's Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan (GSIPP ) and from 1 August 201 1 the Company makes a 
contribution of 16% of his basic salary to the GSIPP on his behalf.

Notes:
1.  Taxable benefits relate to the provision of motor vehicles, telephones and private medical insurance.
2.   The annual bonus is payable in November 2011 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2011. The performance conditions for the 2010/11 bonus were operating profit 
(pre-exceptional items) (80%) and non-financial performance (20%), with non-financial performance being assessed by reference to board structure and succession planning, land bank 
management, health and safety and customer care. The actual bonus payments against each of these metrics were determined on the following basis:
    operating profit was  75.21 million, with no exceptional items, an increase of 46.7% over the previous year. This was substantially above City expectations of underlying profitability and 
at the top end of the target range. The maximum bonus of 80% of salary was therefore achieved.
    in respect of the non-financial elements, the Committee took account of performance against each metric. In 2009/10 the non-financial metrics had not paid out in full, but in 2010/11 
the Company had achieved a significant improvement in its customer care score from 86% to 91%, and reduced its rate of over three-day lost time accidents per 100,000 employees to 
767.90 from 945.18 and had achieved its land bank target for the following financial year. It also completed the successful succession plans for the replacement of Mr Stoker and Mr Leitch. 
This performance triggered a full payout of the non-financial metrics.
3.  Taxable cash payment in lieu of pension contribution amounting to 30% of basic salary.
4.  Mr Stoker did not receive any payment for loss of office on his retirement from the Board.
5.  Retired 15 January 2010.

in the year were  511,267 (2010 -  610,420). 
6. The performance conditions for each award are summarised below:
 (a) For awards made on 16 January 2008, two performance conditions applied to separate parts of the award:
  (i)  50% of the award was based on a TSR condition comparing Bellway's TSR against an index of the TSR of other housebuilders (the Housebuilders Index ). Bellway's TSR was 
compared to that of the Housebuilders Index. If Bellway's TSR matched that of the Housebuilders Index, 25% of the TSR part of the award vested (reduced from the previous 
vesting profile whereby 33% of the award vested at median). Full vesting would be achieved for 7.5% per annum outperformance of the Housebuilders Index. The companies 
comprising the Housebuilders Index are Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc. 
This TSR condition was achieved at 96.6% of the maximum.
  (ii)  The remaining 50% of the award was based on a range of ROCE based targets requiring average annual ROCE of 15% per annum (at which point, 25% of the ROCE part of the 
award would have vested) to 22% per annum for all of this part of the award to have vested. Awards would have vested on a straight-line basis in between these two points. 
This performance condition was not achieved. 
 (b)  For the awards made on 4 November 2008, 29 October 2009 and 21 October 2010 the TSR part of the award applied as the sole performance condition (compared to the same 
companies as for the award made on 16 January 2008).
 (c)  For the awards made on 4 November 2008 and 29 October 2009, regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied 
that the Company's TSR over the performance period is reflective of underlying financial performance. For the 21 October 2010 award and for future awards, no part of the TSR 
element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying financial performance, taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, 
operating margin, ROCE and NAV.
7.  The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 July 2011 was 660.00p and the range during the year was 510.50p to 753.00p.
8. There has been no change in the above potential future beneficial interests between 31 July 2011 and the date of this report.
9.   Following Mr Stoker's retirement from the Board on 31 July 2011, the full three year holding period of each of these awards is to apply up until the normal vesting dates. In respect of the 
awards granted on 4 November 2008 and 29 October 2009, Mr Stoker may exercise the full allocation of shares awarded subject to, and calculated by reference to, the relevant 
performance conditions and subject to the relevant financial underpin. In respect of the award granted on 21 October 2010, Mr Stoker may exercise up to 50% of the allocation of shares 
awarded subject to, and calculated by reference to, the relevant performance conditions and subject to the relevant financial underpin.

Statement of Directors' Responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and Accounts
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state  
of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
   select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
   make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
   state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
   prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and 
Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
   the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
   the Directors' Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs ) as adopted by the EU and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 43, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion on, the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board's (APB's ) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APB's website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm. 
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
   the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 July 201 1 and of the 
Group's profit for the year then ended;
   the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
   the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
   the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
   the part of the Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
   the information given in the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
   adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
   the parent company financial statements and the part of the Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
   certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
   we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
   the directors' statement, set out on page 33, in relation to going concern;
   the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company's compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
   certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors' remuneration.
