 Introduction
This year's remuneration report is presented to shareholders in accordance with the requirements of the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations). In preparing the report the Remuneration Committee has
reviewed remuneration policy for executive directors and in so doing has reaffirmed its commitment to ensure that overall
remuneration continues to be linked to organisational and individual performance and has a clear alignment with the interests
of shareholders.
Remuneration Committee
The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on
behalf of the Board for:
  determining the service conditions and remuneration of all executive directors;
  executive remuneration policy;
  the evaluation of executive director performance with regard to the award of share options, deferred bonus and other
performance based remuneration;
  obtaining independent professional advice in relation to executive director remuneration.
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee has met on five occasions.
Membership and Proceedings of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are all non-executive directors and during the year have comprised Mr A E
Kilburn (Chairman), Mr C G Toner, Mr M Pescod and Mr R J Davies with effect from 5th May 2004.  All Committee members
are considered to be wholly independent with no financial interest, other than as shareholders of the Company, in the
Committee's decisions.  The Group Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee as required but he is not present when
matters affecting his own remuneration are considered.  
Other than as expressly identified in this report the Remuneration Committee has complied with the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance issued in June 1998. The Committee recognises its accountability on executive remuneration to
shareholders through this report and in determining future remuneration policy it will consider both the shareholders' vote on
the report and views expressed by shareholders on the detail of the report.
Advice
Advice is provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary, Mr L Dent, a practising solicitor.  Mr Dent
also acts as secretary to the Committee.  In addition, Watson Wyatt LLP were appointed by the Committee to advise on a range
of issues, including the current market positioning of the Group's executive remuneration having regard to a comparator group
of other housebuilding companies, including Persimmon, Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow and Bellway.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited have advised the Company in relation to various pensions issues and, with
effect from 10th July 2004, were appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance
Scheme.
Remuneration Policy
This report details the company's remuneration policy both for 2004/05, and so far as practicable, for subsequent years.
Any changes made to the policy will be identified in subsequent Remuneration Reports to shareholders.  Central to the Group
remuneration policy is recognition that the sustained growth and profitability of our business is determined in no short
measure by the skill and commitment of the executive team. The reward policy for executive directors seeks to provide
remuneration and other service conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and reward executive directors of the highest
calibre within the industry's highly competitive employment market.  Within these broad objectives the executive remuneration
package is based on the following principles:
  the greater part of remuneration paid to executives should be linked to the achievement of demanding performance
targets, currently over 50% of the total executive remuneration package is performance based;
  performance related remuneration should align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by setting
performance targets based on measures of shareholder return;
  total remuneration for outstanding performance should be competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector;
  executive director remuneration should be determined with due consideration to the rewards and conditions of all Group
employees, particularly in relation to the annual review of basic salary.
Remuneration Report
31 The Remuneration Package for Executive Directors
The remuneration package for executive directors comprises:
  basic salary;
  annual profit related bonus;
  Long-Term Performance Plan;
  share option scheme;
  pension and other benefits.
Typically the performance related element of executive remuneration makes up more than 50% of the total package
excluding pension benefits. The performance conditions which apply to the performance related element of executive
remuneration are the same for all executive directors and are set out in the following sections of this report.
Basic Salary
Basic salaries for executive directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash.  Salaries are set having regard to
individual responsibilities, skills and experience and are currently based on the market median for similar positions in large
national housebuilding companies. Salaries are reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee and the following were
set with effect from 1st July 2004:
  
D A Pretty 416,500 (2003 : 400,400)
H Walker 300,000 (with effect from 1st April 2004) (2003 : 250,000)
S J Boyes 250,000 (2003 : 220,000)
C A Dearlove 235,000 (2003 : 225,000)
C Fenton 250,000 (2003 : 175,000)
P R Gieron 250,000 (2003 : 239,000)
G K Hester 250,000 (2003 : 239,000)
Annual Profit Related Bonus
Each executive director also participates in an annual profit related bonus scheme based on the annual level of the Group's
pre-tax profit with awards made at 0.1333% of the Group's pre-tax profit for the Group Chief Executive, 0.1165% for the
Group Deputy Chief Executive and 0.1% for all other executive directors. A similar annual bonus scheme is operated for senior
management in all Group Regions and Divisions based on a percentage of pre-tax profit for each Region and Division.
As reported in the 2003 Report the annual profit related bonus has been reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.  As
a result of this review a minimum profit hurdle must now be achieved before payouts to executive directors commence.
Although this has not been an issue for the business given the sustained profit growth over the last twelve years, this ensures
that in the event the profit hurdle is not met in the future for any reason bonus payments will not be made.  Above the
minimum profit hurdle bonus payments will be made under a vesting arrangement linked to predetermined profit targets
approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Share Option Schemes
In November 1997 the Company adopted the current Executive Share Option Plan (the Plan).  The grant of share options
under the Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall
performance of the Group.  Options must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be
exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years of grant. The exercise of options granted under the Plan is subject to the
achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee namely that the growth in the earnings
per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index
by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998 and by at least 9% for those options granted in and since 1999.
In accordance with best practice the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance condition and for options
granted after 1st July 2004 the three consecutive financial years over which the earnings per share growth target must be met
will commence with the financial year during which the options are granted.  If the target is not met over this fixed three-year
period then options will lapse.  There will be no retesting of performance.
Pension Benefits
All executive directors are members of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme, which is now closed to new entrants.
The scheme entitles the executive directors with the exceptions of Mr D A Pretty, Mr G K Hester and Mr C Fenton to a pension
on retirement at age 65 of two thirds of final pensionable salary after 40 years membership of the scheme.  The executive
directors are also eligible for dependents pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on death in
service.  The final pension is calculated from the highest yearly average pensionable salary over three consecutive years during
the last ten years of service.
Remuneration Report
32 The entitlements of Mr D A Pretty, Mr G K Hester and Mr C Fenton are restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the
Finance Act 1989.  Under a contractual arrangement entered into in 1992 Mr D A Pretty's pension accrues at the rate of
1/30th but it remains restricted to the earnings cap.
As reported to shareholders in previous remuneration reports, annual profit related bonus is included in the calculation of
final pensionable salary.  The Remuneration Committee recognises that for executive directors the inclusion of profit related
bonus in the calculation of final pensionable salary requires explanation under the Combined Code for Corporate Governance
issued in June 1998. In this regard the inclusion of profit related bonus in the calculation of pensionable salary is a
contractual arrangement of some 25 years standing, which clearly pre-dates the introduction of the Combined Code.
Furthermore, it is an arrangement, which applies equally to all Group management and staff as well as to executive directors.
The Committee is also mindful that apart from the arrangement restricted to the earnings cap provided to Mr D A Pretty no
pension enhancements are offered to Group executive directors whereas such executive pension enhancements are
commonplace elsewhere in the sector and in the majority of listed companies.
An initial review of the existing pension arrangements has been conducted by the Committee, taking into account the
Inland Revenue proposal on the introduction of a lifetime allowance on pensions.
It was anticipated that the Inland Revenue proposal would take effect from 2005.  However this has now been delayed
until 2006, reflecting the significant impact that the proposals will have and the process which companies need to go through
to assess the impact and then to make and implement decisions addressing the issue.
As a result of the delay in issuing final regulations, and the impact which they will have on Group employees beyond the
executive director level, the Remuneration Committee does not intend to implement material changes to the structure of
executive pensions, except in relation to Mr D A Pretty, until next year when the final regulations are issued. This is in
accordance with independent advice, which the Committee has taken. The intention is to deal with the Inland Revenue
proposals and the issue relating to the definition of pensionable salary together, so that changes to pension entitlement are
only made once.
The Committee believes however, that the particular situation of Mr D A Pretty justifies immediate action.  Mr D A Pretty's
pension has been subject to the earnings cap since 1990.  Although an individual contractual arrangement was entered into
in 1992 under which pension accrues at the rate of 1/30th of the earnings cap, it does not address the significant differential
which exists between Mr D A Pretty's pension entitlement and that of his peers elsewhere in the sector, as well as between
Mr D A Pretty and other Group executive directors with similar service who are not subject to the earnings cap. Upon his
appointment, as Group Chief Executive in October 2002 the Remuneration Committee agreed to review Mr D A Pretty's
pension arrangements having regard to the extent of this differential.
As the earnings cap is to be replaced for future service under Inland Revenue proposals to introduce a lifetime allowance
on pensions, it was anticipated that the new arrangements would have presented alternative options for dealing with the
situation, but as stated above implementation of these arrangements has now been delayed.  The Remuneration Committee
believes it is important to address the issue in order to secure Mr D A Pretty's continued services until his retirement.  There
is no intention to compensate for past service, only to put Mr D A Pretty on an equitable footing with the other uncapped
executive directors in respect of current and future service.
Based on calculations carried out by the actuary to the Group scheme Mr D A Pretty will receive with effect from 1st July
2003, a supplement equal to 50% of basic salary, as disclosed in the emoluments table below.  This aims to replicate, for
future service only as from 1st July 2003, the pension he would be entitled to on an uncapped basis, i.e. 1/60th of
pensionable salary.
The pension entitlements for other executive directors will be reviewed over the next year.
Service Contracts
All executive directors are engaged on identical terms on the basis of one year rolling contracts which can be terminated
by 12 months notice given by the Company or by 12 months notice given by the executive at any time.  There are no specific
provisions for compensation on early termination.  The contracts entitle executive directors to the provision of a Company car
and membership of a private health care scheme.

34 Long-Term Performance Plan
As detailed in last year's Remuneration Report and in a separate circular to shareholders, a 3 year rolling Long-Term
Performance Plan was approved by shareholders at last year's Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take effect
from 1st July 2003.  Awards under the new scheme are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent
to a maximum of 100% of basic salary with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three year performance period of the plan,
subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets.  50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target
based on Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth and 50% based on Total Shareholder Return (TSR).  A vesting schedule has
been established so that in terms of EPS growth, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the Retail Price Index (RPI)
plus 15% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 10%, with straight line vesting between these two points. The
remaining 50% will vest subject to TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE Construction and
Building Materials Sector Index.  Again a vesting schedule has been established so that the full 50% will vest if TSR growth
is in the upper quartile of the comparative index and 10% vesting if TSR growth is at the median of the index, with straight
line vesting between the two points. Before any share award vests, independent advice will be taken by the Remuneration
Committee to assess whether the performance criteria have been met. Notional share awards were made under the Scheme
on 27th November 2003 at a share price of 510p.

The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the director would receive if he retired at the end of the year.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the end of the year and that at
the previous year end. The Listing Rules require this to be disclosed excluding inflation.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note
GN11. The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to
transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of the directors' pension benefits. They
do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
