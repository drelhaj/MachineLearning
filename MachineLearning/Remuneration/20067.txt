Directors' remuneration report
This report has been prepared in accordance with Section 234B of the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority (together the Regulations ). The report also describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors' 
remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the 
financial statements of the Company will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' remuneration report and to state whether, 
in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended). The report has therefore been 
divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee's principal responsibility is to determine the remuneration of both the Company's Executive Directors and its senior management 
within broad policies agreed with the Board. In addition, it reviews the remuneration policy for the Company as a whole. The remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors is determined by the Executive Directors and the Chairman, not the Committee.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Remuneration Committee were finalised in two formal meetings during the year, but these were preceded by 
several informal discussions, including some with advisers (none of whom had any other connection with the Company). The members of the Committee were 
David Mann (Chairman), Colin Garrett, Nick Prest, and for part of the year, Jonathan Brooks and Philip Dayer. Jonathan Brooks and Philip Dayer both joined the 
Remuneration Committee on their appointment to the Board. 
The Chief Executive (Richard Longdon) is invited to submit recommendations to the Remuneration Committee and both he and the members of the Committee 
take into consideration relevant external market data as well as the reviews of remuneration for employees of the Group generally.
Remuneration policy 
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that members of the Executive management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced 
performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group. It also aims for a combination 
of fixed and variable payments, benefits and share-based awards that will achieve a balance in incentives to achieve short and long-term goals. 
The Remuneration Committee has access to detailed external research from independent consultants and during the year engaged New Bridge Street Consultants LLP 
to review the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management and to benchmark their remuneration against comparable companies. As part of this 
review, the Board introduced new short-term incentives for Executive Directors and selected employees incorporating a deferred bonus component. Subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions relating to a single financial year, these incentive arrangements are intended to reward the recipient partly in cash, 
payable on announcement of interim and/or final results, and partly in ordinary shares in the Company to be delivered on a deferred basis. 
Under these incentive arrangements, depending on the extent to which performance conditions are achieved, an overall bonus amount is determined. 
Part of this overall bonus amount is payable in cash; an amount equal to the balance (which may be up to 50%) is used to calculate the number of ordinary 
shares which the bonus recipient is eligible to receive on a deferred basis. This is calculated by identifying the number of ordinary shares which could be purchased 
with the balance at the mid-market closing price of an ordinary share on the dealing day immediately preceding the preliminary announcement of the Company's 
results for the relevant financial year.
The Board is seeking shareholder approval to establish an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) and it is intended that the proposed EBT would serve as a mechanism to 
transfer shares purchased in the market to participants in these short-term incentive arrangements. The principal terms of the proposed EBT are included in the 
enclosed notice of Annual General Meeting. The intention is that the EBT would normally deliver the deferred shares to participants in three equal tranches, one 
in each of the three years following the year in which an award is made by the EBT, provided that the participant remains an employee or Director of the Group. 
If the participant ceases to be an employee or Director, entitlement to all outstanding tranches would fall away unless the cessation occurs by reason of his or 
her death. Following the death of a bonus participant, or on a takeover, reconstruction or amalgamation, or voluntary winding up of the Company, the period 
for which the participant must remain an employee or Director would be reduced below the normal three years and entitlement to delivery of the shares would 
be accelerated. There are no arrangements for the delivery of additional matching shares to a participant in any circumstances.
The Board believes that these new incentive arrangements more closely align the interests of Executive Directors and employees with shareholders' interests.
Basic salaries
In determining the basic salary of each Executive Director the Committee takes account of the performance of the Company as a whole and the performance 
of the individual in achieving financial and non-financial goals within his areas of responsibility.
Bonus payments
The Executive Directors participate in annual performance-related bonus arrangements determined by the Committee. The arrangements are based 
substantially or entirely on the performance of the Company as a whole geared towards exceeding internal and external expectations of profit before tax. 
Part of this may also be based on the achievement of personal objectives. Bonus amounts for the year to 31 March 2008 arising under these arrangements 
were  310,000 for Richard Longdon and  200,000 for Paul Taylor. One half of these bonus amounts is payable in cash; it is intended that the remainder of the 
bonus will take the form of a deferred share award where the number of ordinary shares which may be received is determined using the method of calculation 
described above. For the year ended 31 March 2008 there was a cap on the bonus that an Executive Director could achieve under these arrangements and the 
maximum was 100% of basic salary. In view of the excellent results for the year, the Committee decided to award a further cash bonus equivalent of 20% 
of salary, bringing the total bonus amounts to  372,000 (2007 -  275,100) for Richard Longdon and  240,000 (2007 -  183,500) for Paul Taylor. AVEVA Group plc   Annual report 2008   Directors' report

Total shareholder return performance graph
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the presentation of a performance graph of total shareholder return compared with a broad 
equity market index for a period of five years. The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the 
performance of the techMARK All-Share Index. Total shareholder return is the share price plus dividends reinvested compared against techMARK All-Share Index, 
rebased to the start of the period. 
Total shareholder return v techMARK All-Share Index 2003-2008
The Directors consider the techMARK All-Share Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index includes AVEVA Group plc.
Share awards
The Remuneration Committee considers that periodic grants of share-related incentives should constitute an important element of the remuneration of 
the Company's senior Executives, in line with common practice in comparator companies. The Company's share schemes have therefore been used to provide 
long-term incentives to assist in creating and sustaining growth in share value. There are three schemes in existence, the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share 
Option Scheme, the AVEVA Group plc Long-Term Incentive Plan and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007. The number of shares which may 
be allocated on exercise of any options granted under any of the Company's share option schemes (including employee schemes) shall not, when aggregated 
with the number of shares which have been allocated in the previous ten years under these schemes, exceed 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company 
in issue immediately prior to that date. As recipients of these awards, Executive Directors and senior management are required to hold or build share ownership 
with a value of at least 100% of their then current salary. Details of the awards made under these schemes are as follows: 
2004/05 awards
In 2004 the Remuneration Committee commissioned a study by Deloitte & Touche LLP to review the Company's share option schemes and to make recommendations 
on their development. The Board accepted those recommendations and, following consultation with shareholders, the Company established the AVEVA Group 
plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which was approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting held in 2004. Under the LTIP, options are granted to selected 
individuals to acquire ordinary shares at an exercise price equal to the nominal value of the shares; these options will be exercisable only if stringent 
performance criteria are met.
At the Extraordinary General Meeting in 2004, shareholders also approved that the dilution limits under the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option scheme be 
extended to enable further awards to be made under this scheme.
In 2004/05, a total of 63,000 options were awarded to Executive Directors under the LTIP. The condition of exercise for these awards was based on the ranking 
of the Company in terms of its total shareholder return measured against the techMARK 100 Index. The option  vested' in accordance with the following scale:
Total shareholder return ranking       Percentage vesting of shares subject to option
75% and above         100%
Median to 75%        Pro rata on a straight-line basis
Median         33%
Below median         Nil
The performance conditions were measured three years from the date of grant and all awards vested in full.
2005/06 awards
The AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1996 at the time of the Company's listing on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange. 
In 2005/06, a total of 162,816 options under the scheme were awarded to Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee felt that awards made as market value 
options were better suited at that time to the Company's circumstances.
The performance conditions required to be achieved for the exercise of the option were that Earnings per Share (EPS) in the financial year ending 31 March 2008 
would have grown to no less than 5% above the Retail Price Index per annum from that achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2005. The performance 
condition was judged to be appropriately stretching because of the investment planned in the VNET programme during the period. AVEVA Group plc   Annual report 2008   Directors' report

Share awards continued
2006/07 awards
In 2006/07 a total of 42,588 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP. The Committee decided to revert to this scheme, with 
performance conditions based on growth in EPS, but in this case the average growth in EPS achieved over the three years from 2006/07 to 2008/09. If average 
EPS growth is greater than 15% per annum then all of the shares shall vest. If average EPS growth is less than 7.5% per annum none of the shares shall vest. 
If average EPS growth is between 7 .5% and 15% then the number of shares that shall vest will be determined by linear interpolation. The Remuneration Committee 
considered that these were challenging performance conditions in the context of the Company's budget and market expectations at the time of the awards.
2007/08 awards
In 2007/08, a total of 18,234 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP. The performance conditions are based on average growth in 
earnings per share over the years from 2007/08 to 2009/10. If average EPS growth is greater than 11.5% per annum then all of the shares shall vest. If average 
earnings per share is less than 9% per annum then none of the shares shall vest. If average earnings per share growth is between 9% and 11.5% per annum then 
the number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation. The Remuneration Committee considered that these were challenging performance 
conditions in the context of internal and external expectations at the time of the awards.
Service contracts
The service contracts and letters of appointment of the Directors include the following terms:
  Date of contract Date of appointment Notice period (months)
Nick Prest  10 January 2006 11 January 2006 3
David Mann  17 May 2000 8 June 1999 3
Colin Garrett  14 July 2000 1 August 2000 3
Jonathan Brooks  12 July 2007 12 July 2007 3
Philip Dayer  27 December 2007 7 January 2008 3
Richard Longdon  28 November 1996 28 November 1996 12
Paul Taylor  17 October 1989 1 March 2001 9
The Committee considers that the notice periods of the Executive Directors are in line with those in other companies of a similar size and nature and are in the 
best interests of the Group to ensure stability in senior management. 
There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive or Non-Executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of office. 
The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for considering the circumstances of the early termination of an Executive Director's contract and 
determining whether in exceptional circumstances there should be compensation payments in excess of the Company's contractual obligations.

The market price as at 31 March 2008 was  11.39 (31 March 2007 -  8.19) with a high-low spread for the year of  8.00 to  12.00. 
During the year, in advance of the proposed changes to the Capital Gains Tax legislation, Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor sold 500,000 and 24,000 ordinary 
shares respectively (all of which were already owned) at a price of  10.68.
At the same time Paul Taylor exercised options over a further 27 ,000 ordinary shares at an exercise price of 3.33p of which 3,000 ordinary shares were sold at a price 
of  10.68. The market price on the date of exercise was  10.68 which resulted in an aggregate gain on exercise of  287 ,460 (2007 -  1,161,063). At 31 March 2008, 
Paul Taylor held 50,000 ordinary shares and options over 88,262 ordinary shares.
Richard Longdon subsequently purchased 280,000 ordinary shares at  10.58 and exercised options over 36,000 ordinary shares at an exercise price of 3.33p 
and retained the resultant shares. The market price on the date of exercise was  10.78 which resulted in a gain on exercise of  386,880 (2007 -  1,635,000). 
At 31 March 2008, Richard Longdon held 316,000 ordinary shares and options over 135,376 ordinary shares. 
The options are normally exercisable in full or in part between the third and seventh anniversaries of the date of grant. Details of the performance conditions 
of share option awards are set out on pages 34 and 35.
Pensions
During the year, two Executive Directors (Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor) were members of AVEVA Solutions Limited's defined benefit pension scheme. It is a 
contributory, funded, occupational pension scheme registered with HMRC and, since 1 October 2004, Career Average Revalued Earnings benefits apply. Under this 
scheme they are entitled to a pension on normal retirement, or on retirement due to ill health, equivalent to two-thirds of their pensionable salary provided they 
have completed (or would have completed in the case of ill-health) 25 years' service. A pension earnings cap (in line with historic HMRC's earning cap) applies to 
Paul Taylor when calculating pensionable salary. Similarly, a scheme-specific earnings limit applies to the benefits earned by Richard Longdon. A lower pension is 
payable on earlier retirement after the age of 50 by agreement with the Company. Pensions are payable to dependants on the Director's death in retirement and 
a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service. No other Directors were members of a pension scheme during the year (2007 - nil). AVEVA Group plc   Annual report 2008   Directors' report
