 Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and meets
the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code. A resolution will be put to shareholders at the
Company's Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2010 inviting them to consider and approve this report. The auditors are required to report to the Company's
members on that part of this remuneration report which is subject to audit and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. This report is therefore presented in two sections: unaudited information and audited information.
Section 1: Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up solely of non-executive directors with no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters to 
be decided. Those non-executive directors serving on the Remuneration Committee during 2009 were Mr Colin Holmes as Chairman, Mr John Warren, 
Mrs Lesley MacDonagh and Mr Alastair Lyons. Meetings of the Remuneration Committee are held as and when appropriate and at least annually. 
During 2009, the Remuneration Committee met on six occasions and all members attended each meeting. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, from time to time, calls upon Mr Malcolm Harris (Chairman) and also Mr David Ritchie (Chief Executive) to assist in discussions
and deliberations of the Remuneration Committee on remuneration matters not pertaining to their own remuneration or terms and conditions of
employment. The Remuneration Committee has, on occasion, appointed the services of external advisers to advise on remuneration. During 2009, the
Remuneration Committee carried out a remuneration adviser review and in August 2009 appointed Deloitte LLP as adviser to the Committee on an ongoing
basis. The Hay Group acted until that date. Deloitte LLP has no other connection with the Company and provides reports and advice and attend Committee
meetings as required. ExcellerateHRO Share Plan Services (formerly Towers Perrin) act as Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan. 
The Group Company Secretary, Mr Martin Palmer, acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
Duties of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the following duties:
  Determine on behalf of the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive, the
executive directors and circa thirty five members of senior management. 
  Within that framework/policy, determine the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman, Chief Executive, each executive director and other
designated senior executives, including, where appropriate, bonuses and share awards, having regard to the pay and conditions of employees throughout
the Company.
  Ensure that executive directors and senior management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are rewarded
for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
  Determine targets for any performance related pay schemes and ask the Board, when appropriate, to seek shareholder approval for any long term 
incentive arrangements.
  Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance criteria of all share based remuneration schemes.
  Ensure that contractual terms on termination and any payments made avoid rewarding poor performance and approve any severance payments.
  Determine the policy for and scope of service agreements for executive directors and pensions arrangements, termination payments and compensation
commitments.
  Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance conditions of the annual bonus scheme and approve annual bonuses.
  In determining remuneration packages and arrangements, give due regard to the requirements and recommendations of the Combined Code as well as
the UK Listing Authority's Listing Rules and associated guidance.
  Review competitor companies but ensure that automatic increases are not implemented.
  Oversee any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company.
  Ensure that the provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration, including pensions, as set out in The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 are fulfilled and produce an annual report of the Committee's remuneration policy to be included in the
Company's Annual Report and Accounts.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Group's website www.bovishomes.co.uk/plc and on request to the Group

Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company's policy for the remuneration of executive directors, having regard to The Large and Medium-sized
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (Regulation 11 and Schedule 8) and the Combined Code and its provisions on directors'
remuneration, including Schedule A.
The Remuneration Committee sets and implements remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and designated senior management. 
The Remuneration Committee determines the need for independent professional advice where appropriate and has regard to information on compensation
and salary levels in companies in the housebuilding sector and in other companies of comparable size and complexity. The objectives of the remuneration
policy are to:
  ensure that the individual rewards and incentives fairly relate to the performance of the individual, the Company and the interests of shareholders;
  maintain a remuneration package which enables the Company to attract, retain, and motivate executives of the appropriate calibre and experience to
further the success of the Company and maximise long term shareholder value; and
  take into account pay and employment conditions throughout the Company.
The remuneration policy was reviewed by the Remuneration Committee during 2009.
Report on directors' remuneration
42 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomes.co.uk/plc Remuneration package
The remuneration package of the executive directors consists of basic salary, performance bonus, health insurance, membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated
Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS), pension, death in service assurance, and participation in employee share schemes and the Bovis Homes
Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee aims to balance appropriately fixed remuneration with those elements of an executive director' s remuneration which are subject
to explicit performance conditions, accepting that all remuneration is linked with ongoing appraisal of individual performance. By virtue of the various
elements of directors' remuneration subject to performance conditions, a significant part is variable and is not guaranteed. The potential remuneration
package, dependent on performance, reflects one-third fixed and two-thirds variable elements. Whilst the Remuneration Committee aims to achieve this
balance, it recognises that the payout in any year will vary from this. The chart below to the left shows this graphically.
For remuneration earned during 2009 the fixed element, being salary, and variable elements, which includes bonus and gains on the exercise of LTIP awards
granted in 2006, are shown, by director, in the two charts immediately above and to the right. The opportunity to earn cash bonus awards in 2009 was
replaced by awards under the Bonus Replacement Share Plan and therefore no cash bonus awards were made. As Mr Neil Cooper commenced with the
Company on 2 January 2007 he had no entitlement to exercise awards under the LTIP during 2009.
Salary
Executive director salaries are reviewed annually to take effect from 1 January, taking into account the total remuneration package at the time of the review
and having regard to the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Company. No salary increases were awarded to the executive directors in either
of the 2009 and 2010 reviews.
External directorships
Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and organisations outside 
the Group. Neither of the executive directors currently has any such appointments.
Annual performance bonus
Until 2008, executive directors were able to earn a performance cash bonus up to a maximum of 100% of basic annual salary prevailing at the date of the
Remuneration Committee meeting to determine bonuses assessed. These bonuses were paid from a bonus pool generated from increases in profits over the
previous year.
No bonuses were paid to executive directors in 2008 or 2009 in respect of the 2007 or 2008 financial years.
As a result of trading conditions within the UK housing market and the Group's focus during 2009 on cash flow generation, the Remuneration Committee
considered it inappropriate to continue the existing cash bonus scheme during 2009 and, following shareholder approval, entitlement to be considered for
cash bonus in 2009 was forfeited by the executive directors, and replaced by awards in a Bonus Replacement Share Plan.
With a return to corporate objectives more typical for a UK housebuilder and with a greater level of visibility over housing market conditions towards the end
of 2009, expected to continue through 2010, the Remuneration Committee has decided to revert to a conventional annual bonus scheme designed as a long
term arrangement with flexibility to adapt to a range of market conditions. A mix of performance measures will be used, with the proportion applying to
each measure being determined by the Remuneration Committee at the start of each year. The approach is designed to result in a balanced remuneration
package, aligned with business strategy. A consultation with major shareholders took place on the revised annual bonus arrangements which had a supportive
outcome, and comments received from shareholders have been reflected in the design of the bonus arrangements.
The executive directors continue to have a bonus cap equal to 100% of basic annual salary prevailing at the date of the Remuneration Committee meeting
to determine bonus earned. These maximum bonus caps provide an appropriate level of short term incentive which is aligned with performance bonus
arrangements of other house building companies and listed companies of similar size and complexity.
Any bonus will normally be paid in cash. However, before paying cash bonuses the Remuneration Committee will review the proposed position regarding
dividends. If no dividend is proposed, the Remuneration Committee may choose to exercise its discretion to pay all, or part, of the bonus in ordinary shares,
with the right to receive the shares normally deferred for two years.
The overall principles applying to the mix of performance measures are:
  at least 70% of the bonus will be based on financial measures, with the balance being based on non-financial measures;
  the financial criteria are likely to include one or more of profit before tax, return on capital employed and cash flow
  the non-financial measures are likely to include one or both of health and safety and customer service

400 The Remuneration Committee has decided that the performance measures for the 2010 performance bonus opportunity will be based 80% on financial
measures and 20% on non-financial measures. The financial measures are profit before tax, cash flow and management of land acquisition. The non-financial
measures are health and safety and customer service. Suitably stretching 2010 targets have been set by the Remuneration Committee for each performance
measure, based on appropriate internal and external metrics, including analysts' forecasts for the Company and the sector.
All office based employees receive separate consideration for bonus based on the achievement of bonus performance criteria and personal performance to
be paid from profits generated during the year. Site employees are incentivised through direct site bonus schemes based on measurable site performance.
Sales staff are incentivised through separate commission arrangements.
Pension
Mr David Ritchie is a senior executive member of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme. This is a part contributory funded, defined benefit scheme approved by
HMRC. Pensionable earnings were equal to basic pay prior to 6 April 2006. From 6 April 2006, increases in pensionable earnings are restricted each year to
the lesser of the percentage increase in basic pay and 2.5%. Mr Ritchie is subject to the statutory earnings cap for service until 5 April 2006 and, following
the introduction of the lifetime allowance pension rules on 6 April 2006, is not subject to an earnings cap for service from 6 April 2006. Normal retirement
age for senior executive members under the scheme is 60, and the accrual rate is 1/45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service as a senior
executive.
Mr Neil Cooper was a member of the Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan during 2009, a contracted-in defined contribution arrangement, to which
the Company contributes 7% of basic annual salary per annum. Normal retirement age for joiners after 1 October 2006 is age 65.
Share schemes
The Company operates the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior management. The granting of awards under the
Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The performance conditions are designed to challenge and motivate executive directors to improve
profitability and enhance shareholder return. The conditions are also designed to require strong collective and individual performance from the executive
directors before options and awards vest, whilst at the same time offering a credible opportunity for success. The current Long Term Incentive Plan was
adopted in 2000 and will expire at the 2010 Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, approval will be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to
a new Long Term Incentive Plan.
Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan 2000
The current Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2000 Annual General Meeting. Under
the rules of the plan a participant may receive in respect of any financial year a maximum award of shares with a market value, when the award is made, not
exceeding 100% of basic salary. Each award is made subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria and awards may only be exercised at the end
of three years. There is no cost to the participants in the plan to exercise the awards.
The extent to which the awards may be exercised is determined by two measures of performance; total shareholder return ( TSR') and earnings per share
( EPS') growth, each measured over a three year performance period and each relating to half of the shares awarded.
The TSR measure requires the comparison of the growth in the Company's TSR over a three year period to that of a group of comparator companies in the
housebuilding industry specified by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the performance period. TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and
dividends paid during the three year period (assuming that such dividends are reinvested in ordinary shares).
The TSR measure assesses performance relative to the median over the three year performance period, as derived from the TSR performance of the comparator
companies. Measuring performance against the median provides a robust approach and one less prone to distortions and as being viable for smaller
comparator groups. Vesting is as follows:
TSR performance % of total award which can be realised
Maximum TSR performance 50% of the shares in the award
Threshold TSR performance 15% of the shares in the award
Threshold TSR performance is set at the median growth in TSR of the comparator group and for 2007, 2008 and 2009 awards, maximum TSR performance
is set at median plus 15% growth in TSR. Where TSR performance falls between the threshold and the maximum TSR performance, the percentage of shares
which can be realised will be calculated on a straight line sliding scale. Where TSR falls below median, none of the shares in the award judged by reference
to TSR can be realised.
The group of comparator companies is comprised as follows:
Comparator companies
Barratt Developments PLC The Berkeley Group plc Taylor Wimpey plc
Bellway p.l.c. Persimmon plc Redrow Group plc
The Remuneration Committee has also determined that the performance of companies acquired during the three year performance period will from the date
of acquisition be notionally reinvested in the company which has the median TSR performance from the date of acquisition to the end of the performance
period (excluding other acquired companies), maintaining the number of comparator companies and the vesting schedule based on ranking for these awards.
The EPS growth measure is based on the extent to which the Company's average annual EPS growth over the three year performance period falls between
minimum and maximum EPS growth targets set by the Remuneration Committee as follows:
EPS growth % of total award which can be realised
Maximum EPS growth 50% of the shares in the award
Threshold EPS growth 20% of the shares in the award
Report on directors' remuneration continued
44 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomes.co.uk/plc For 2007 and 2008 awards, the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets are 4% and 10% per annum above RPI respectively. Where EPS growth falls
between the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets, the number of shares which can be realised will be determined on a straight line sliding scale.
Where EPS growth falls below 4% above RPI, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS growth can be realised. Following a consultation
with major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee set absolute levels of EPS to be achieved during the performance period for awards granted in 2009
of 20p and 50p per share as the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets to be measured in the third year of the performance period. Again following
consultation, awards granted to executive directors in 2009 were reduced to 80% of basic salary.
The 2010 awards are the last to be made under the current Long Term Incentive Plan and the Remuneration Committee has considered the performance
measures to apply having regard to the size and complexity of the Company and having consulted with major shareholders. Following an analysis of total
compensation arrangements the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that a maximum award of 100% of salary is an appropriate level of award for the
executive directors and this has received the support of major shareholders. 2010 awards granted to the executive directors did not exceed 100% of basic salary.
In carrying out an evaluation of the minimum and maximum absolute EPS growth targets that should apply, the Remuneration Committee formed the view
that the targets set for the 2009 awards, based on data providing limited visibility in difficult market conditions and predicated on anticipation of a faster
recovery in the housing market than has transpired, rest some way above a reasonable range for a stretching yet realistically achievable performance measure.
As a result, the Remuneration Committee has considered the EPS growth targets for the 2010 awards afresh, with reference to data providing greater visibility
over the three year performance period, including internal forecasts and analysts' forecasts, and has also reviewed the proportion of awards that should vest
at threshold EPS growth. A connected area of concern is the inherent difficulty in setting three year point-to-point EPS growth targets in the current
environment and the Remuneration Committee has therefore considered use of a cumulative three year EPS growth target for the 2010 awards. Again major
shareholders were consulted to ascertain their views on this point and support was expressed. Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has set absolute
minimum and maximum EPS growth targets of 35p and 50p per share for the 2010 awards, to be measured on a cumulative basis over the three year
performance period, with threshold EPS growth vesting 15% of the shares in an award, as opposed to 20% used for all previous awards.
The Remuneration Committee has also considered the TSR performance targets for the 2010 awards and reviewed historic TSR performance in the
housebuilders comparator group and wider practice amongst FTSE 350 companies. This resulted in threshold TSR performance for the 2010 awards being
set at the median, as for previous awards, and maximum TSR performance being set at median plus 10% growth in TSR of the comparator group, deemed
to be equivalent to achieving at least upper quartile performance based on historic TSR performance. Again, the views of major shareholders were sought on
this matter and support was received.
The shares required to satisfy the awards have been purchased by the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust. The grant price of the awards is set as the market
value of the shares at the date of grant. The market value of the shares attributable to each director will be included in remuneration in the year in which the
awards are exercised. An award may only be exercised within six months of the realisation date, the realisation date being the date of notification from the
Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust that the award is realisable in whole or in part.
Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan 2010
The current Long Term Incentive Plan will expire at the 2010 Annual General Meeting and the March 2010 awards will be the last to be made under that
Plan. Shareholder approval will accordingly be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to a new Long Term Incentive Plan which is broadly similar
to the current Plan and will use the same performance measures, subject to any appropriate review, whilst taking account of developments in best practice.
Following consultation, major shareholders have indicated that they are supportive of the new Plan, which will be used to grant future awards.
Bovis Homes Group PLC 2009 Bonus Replacement Share Plan
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Bonus Replacement Share Plan was approved at the 2009 Annual General Meeting and is designed to encourage and reward
participants for delivering business recovery that results in the creation of shareholder value. The Plan has been operated in 2009 only as an alternative to
entitlement for consideration for cash bonus. The executive directors and directors of the Group's operating subsidiary, Bovis Homes Limited, agreed to forfeit
their entire entitlement to be considered for cash bonus in 2009. Other senior managers agreed to forfeit 70% of their entitlement to be considered for cash
bonus. In all cases, the value of the award in the Bonus Replacement Share Plan is less than or equal to the value of the cash bonus entitlement forfeited.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion over the vesting of awards, should the performance condition be met, to ensure that the contribution from
management is properly reflected, and that vesting is not influenced by favourable stock market movement. In addition to the overall circumstances in which
the performance condition is achieved, the Remuneration Committee would have regard to such metrics as net assets per share, profitability and dividend
affordability. Awards were granted on 7 May 2009 and will be capable of exercise, should the performance condition be met, for a period of six months
following 7 May 2012.
The performance condition is linked to an average share price target to be measured at the end of the performance period. The average market value of a
share achieved over the three months immediately preceding the end of the performance period will determine the number of shares which will vest. Vesting
will be calculated in accordance with the following table and is subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, as mentioned above:
Average share price achieved Percentage of shares in award that vest
 7.00 100%
 6.00 50%
 5.50 25%
Less than  5.50 nil
The number of shares that will vest will be calculated on a straight-line basis for average share prices achieved between  5.50 and  7.00. Operated in 2009
only, the Plan will terminate on the conclusion of the 2010 Annual General Meeting, with outstanding awards remaining in existence.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997 and expired in 2007, with the granting of options being suspended in
2004. Options granted to one executive director are still current. The performance criteria require that any share option held under the Scheme can only
normally be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in RPI by at
least 4% per annum over three consecutive years. Assuming the performance criteria are satisfied, share options may, under normal circumstances, be
exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from the date of grant.

Service agreements and terms of appointment
In respect of each of the executive directors, the service agreements are rolling twelve month contracts with a twelve month notice period due from either
employer or employee.
In addition to their salaries, the executive directors are entitled to participate in the Bovis Homes' employee share schemes and the Long Term Incentive Plan,
and to be considered for an annual performance bonus, dependent on the achievement of targets set down annually by the Remuneration Committee. For
2009 they received awards under the 2009 Bonus Replacement Share Plan having agreed to forfeit their entitlement to be considered for a performance
bonus in 2009. They are also entitled to membership of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme as a senior executive where service began on or before 2001,
membership of the defined contribution pension plan where service began after 2001 and between 24 and 27 working days holiday per annum determined
by length of service. The directors hold membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS). There are no specific
provisions for compensation on early termination.
The non-executive directors have entered into service agreements for their services which are established for periods up to three years duration based upon
the frequency of re-election to the Board with notice periods up to twelve months. The service agreements for the non-executive directors are available for
inspection on request to the Group Company Secretary. The fees for their services were last reviewed as follows:

Changes in the number of ordinary shares held arose from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards, and investment during the year in partnership
shares through the HMRC approved Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan. There were no changes in the holdings of ordinary shares of any of the directors
between 31 December 2009 and 5 March 2010, other than the normal monthly investment in partnership shares through the Bovis Homes Group Share
Incentive Plan.
The directors' interests in share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on pages 49 to 50. There were no changes in the holdings
of share options and awards under the 2009 Bonus Replacement Share Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan between 31 December 2009 and 5 March
2010. LTIP awards granted to Mr Malcolm Harris whilst an executive director continue in force until the third anniversary of the award date and, should either
of the two measures of performance be met, the number of shares which can be realised will be reduced according to the proportion of the three year
performance period following cessation of employment, measured in complete months, relative to the three year performance period. Executive share options
in existence for Mr Malcolm Harris as at his date of retirement lapsed on 3 July 2009, twelve months later.
Share ownership guidelines
There exist guidelines for executive directors in respect of share ownership of Bovis Homes' shares. The Board expects executive directors benefiting from the
exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of share options to retain at least 50% of the net value derived from the exercise, after settling all
costs and income tax due, as shares. This guideline is expected to be applied until such time as the executive director holds shares with a market value equal
to current basic annual salary.

Executive director salaries were last increased by the Remuneration Committee on 1 July 2008 ahead of the retirement of Mr Malcolm Harris, the promotion
of Mr David Ritchie and the reduction in executive directors from three to two. Appropriate external independent advice was received as part of this review.
Subsequent to the 1 July 2008 review, the Company's annual salary review date was changed to 1 January each year. Salaries were reviewed to take effect
from 1 January 2009 and a standard  no rise' principle was adopted, with the result that there was no proposal requiring consideration by the Remuneration
Committee in respect of the executive directors. Salaries were last reviewed to take effect from 1 January 2010 and again no increase was recommended for
the executive directors.

Report on directors' remuneration continued
50 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomes.co.uk/plc The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements, in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent
Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
  for the Group and Parent Company financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company's transactions and disclose
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a directors' report, report on directors' remuneration and report on
corporate governance that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in
the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
a) the Group and Parent Company financial statements in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRIC
interpretation and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and of the Group taken as a whole; and
b) the management report contained in this report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the
Company and the Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
