Remuneration policy and structure 
The Committee is responsible for remuneration policies that are consistent with the Group's overall business strategy and thereby attract 
and retain high calibre executives at the same time as delivering value for shareholders. Remuneration includes both fixed and variable 
elements of pay, variable pay being clearly linked to superior performance. The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed 
and variable performance based pay for each Executive Director based on the maximum entitlements.

Annual Report 2011
When the package is reviewed this is done in the context of individual and Company performance, internal relativities, criticality of the 
individual to the business, experience and the scarcity or otherwise of talent with the relevant skill set. Currently reward for the Executive 
Directors is structured as follows:
Element of pay Component Purpose / details
Fixed p  Base salary p  To ensure competitiveness, attracting and retaining talent
p  To reflect individual skills and experience 
p  Benefits p  In line with market practice 
p  Provision of Company car (or allowance in lieu of), private medical insurance and long-term 
disability insurance
p  Pension p  In line with market practice
p  To ensure competitiveness, attracting and retaining talent
Variable p  Annual bonus p  To incentivise delivery of corporate objectives and strategy
p  To provide opportunity for enhanced reward in return for challenging performance targets
p  Bodycote Incentive Plan p  To incentivise delivery of long-term shareholder value and provide opportunity for enhanced 
reward for superior performance 
p  Bodycote Co-Investment Plan p  To align Executive Directors with shareholders, demonstrate individual commitment and 
satisfy minimum shareholding requirements
Each of the above components is discussed in greater detail in the following sections of this report. The sections dealing with Directors' 
emoluments paid, pensions and incentives have been audited. 
Fixed elements of pay 
Base salary
The Committee reviews base salaries for each Executive Director and senior executives annually taking into account the responsibilities 
and performance of the individual, current market practice, pay in similar engineering businesses and companies of a comparable size 
and scale of operations. The Committee was also mindful of pay levels amongst the employee population.
The salaries of the Executive Directors during 2011 are as follows:
Name Position Salary from 1 January 2011
S.C. Harris Chief Executive Officer  436,000
D.F . Landless Finance Director  278,500
Pension
The Committee reviews the pension arrangements for the Executive Directors to ensure that the benefits provided are consistent with 
those provided by other similar companies.
Mr Harris is entitled to a salary supplement in lieu of pension at a rate of 22% of basic salary, of which  72,000 was waived from April 
2011. In addition, in the event of death, a death in service benefit of eight times basic salary will become payable. 
During 2011 the pension for Mr Landless was provided partly under the Group's UK contributory defined benefit pension scheme, which 
is closed to new members with increases in pensionable salary capped at 3% per annum, and partly through a defined contribution 
arrangement. The Group's contribution to Mr Landless' defined contribution arrangement in the period January to March 2011 was 16% 
of basic salary above the defined benefit scheme cap.
The defined benefit scheme also provides lump sum death-in-service benefits and pension benefits based on final pensionable salary. 
An analysis of the accrued pension entitlements for Mr Landless under the defined benefit pension scheme during 2011 is given on 
page 48.
Variable elements of pay 
Annual bonuses
The annual bonus provides the Executive Directors and other senior executives with the opportunity to receive an annual bonus wholly 
payable in cash based on achievement of certain performance targets. In 2011 the annual bonus scheme for the Executive Directors was 
structured as follows:
Name

Business review Governance	 Financial statements Additional information
The Committee also has discretion to reduce the awards by up to 10% if the safety performance is less than targeted. 
For 2012 the Committee has determined that the bonus opportunity for Executive Directors and senior executives will again be 
contingent on meeting targets relating to safety, operating profit, cash management and personal objectives. No bonus will be paid for 
the cash management element unless the level of operating profit achieved is at least 95% of target.
Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP) 
The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares 
up to a maximum of 175% of base salary. Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period.
50% of the award is subject to a return on capital employed (ROCE ) performance condition and 50% of the award is subject to an 
earnings per share (EPS ) performance condition.
ROCE EPS
Award year Threshold performance Maximum performance Threshold performance Maximum performance
2009 10% 14.6% 16.0p 28.0p
2010 11 .1% 16% 19.8p 31 .0p
2011 14.6% 20% 28.3p 39.8p
2012 18.7% 23% 36.2p 62.15p
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest. Regardless of 
ROCE performance, should EPS at the end of the performance period be below 16p for any BIP awards made between 2009 and 2011 
and below 31.1p for awards made in 2012, then no award shall vest. 
The Committee intends to use the ROCE and EPS measures in combination for BIP Awards made in 2012. Details of the awards made 
under the BIP are provided on page 47. Following completion of the performance period on 31 December 2011, the Remuneration 
Committee has determined that 175% of the BIP awards made in 2009 shall vest (2008: nil). In reaching this conclusion, the 
Remuneration Committee took into account specific audit procedures carried out by the external auditors.
During the financial year the Remuneration Committee also approved the introduction of the Bodycote Investment Incentive Plan which 
provided a long-term savings vehicle for senior executives which aids retention whilst recognising the needs for flexibility in long-term 
wealth planning. Company contributions are discretionary and vary year on year. Contributions for the Executive Directors are shown 
on page 47.
Bodycote Co-investment Plan ( CIP') 
The CIP provides a link between the Company's short and long-term incentive arrangements and permits executives to invest in shares 
up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary. The CIP provides for the grant of awards of matching shares to participants on an 
annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred shares. Deferred shares must be held for three years and 
matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return ( TSR') target. The threshold target for CIP matching awards is TSR 
growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) for a threshold matching ratio 
of 1:2. 10% per annum compound growth in excess of growth in the CPI will be required for a vesting matching ratio of 1:1.
Details of the awards under the CIP together with awards made under the legacy arrangement known as the Bodycote Share Match 
Plan ( BSMP') and the joining award made to Mr Harris in October 2008 are noted on page 48. Following completion of the performance 
period on 31 December 2011, the Remuneration Committee has determined that 100% of the matching awards made in 2009 under 
the BSMP and 100% of the joining award shall vest.
Advisers
During the year the Committee has taken independent advice from Ernst & Young LLP on remuneration together with legal advice from 
Eversheds. Fees relating to the Ernst & Young LLP services were  60,000, which included, amongst other things, benchmarking of 
executive salaries, advice on the impact of changes to the UK pensions regime, implementation of an approved French sub-plan, advice 
relating to the accounting costs of the Company's share plans and the transfer of the Company's employee benefit trust to a new 
trustee. Fees for Eversheds legal advice were  5,000 which related to the review of non-executive directors' letters of appointment and 
claw back. 
Total Shareholder Return 
The graph on page 47 illustrates the Company's TSR performance since 2006 relative to the FTSE All Share Industrial Index of which 
the Company is a component part. This sector is considered the most appropriate comparator Group over the five-year period to 
December 2011. In line with market practice the calculation for TSR assumes reinvestment of dividends and is based on data provided 
by Datastream. 46 Bodycote plc
Annual Report 2011
Service contracts 
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period. All the Executive Directors have 
service agreements which are terminable by one year's notice by the employer at any time, and by payment of one year's remuneration 
in lieu of notice by the employer. With the exception of David Landless, the Executive Directors do not have a change of control clause. 
David Landless' service contract was agreed in accordance with what was considered best practice at the time of its execution in 2001 
and provides for one year's remuneration on a change of control if his employment is terminated. To the extent that executive contracts 
are renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy of best practice when entering into service 
contracts. In any case legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic 
salary, annual incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of any Executive Director, other than 
payments made on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice. Mr Harris' service agreement is dated 6 October 2008 and Mr 
Landless' contract is dated 26 September 2001.
Shareholding policy 
In 2005, the Committee introduced a shareholding retention policy under which Executive Directors and other senior executives are 
expected, within five years of that date or commencement of employment if later, to build up a shareholding in the Company. In respect 
of Executive Directors the expectation is to hold at least 100% of basic salary. As at 31 December 2011 the Committee is satisfied that 
the Executive Directors have fulfilled this requirement.
Fees retained for external non-executive directorships
Executive Directors may hold positions in other companies as non-executive directors. Stephen Harris was the only Executive Director 
with such a position held at Mondi plc from 1 March 2011 and in accordance with Group policy he retained fees for the year of  59,035.
Non-Executive Directors 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for 
the Chairman is determined by the whole Board (excluding the Chairman). Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
takes into account the time commitments and duties and responsibilities involved. The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director hold 
letters of appointment which have been agreed in accordance with best practice which set out the terms of his appointment, including 
membership of Board committees, the fees to be paid and the time commitment expected from the Director. The letter also covers 
such matters as the confidentiality of information and Bodycote's share dealing code. During the year letters of appointment for the 
Chairman and each Non-Executive Director were renewed, each for a period of no longer than three years. Each is terminable under the 
Company's Articles of Association, the Act, by the Director's resignation or otherwise on six months' notice if termination occurs before 
expiry of the term. To determine the fees it pays to Non-Executive Directors, the Board takes into account the need to attract individuals 
of appropriate calibre and expertise, the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors by other companies of a similar size and scale of 
operations and the time commitment attached to each appointment. The Board keeps fees under review. The Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors are not entitled to any pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.

Over the year to 31 December 2011, the Trustee of the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme has reviewed the basis on which transfer values are calculated to allow for 
the change of statutory indexation from RPI to CPI. The transfer value at 31 December 2011 incorporates these changes. The transfer value at 1 January 2011 does 
not include any allowance for CPI indexation. For information, had the Trustee reviewed the transfer value basis prior to 1 January 2011, the transfer value quoted 
at 1 January 2011 would have been  627,000. The inflation used above is a measure consistent with the CPI assumption used in the transfer value basis for the 
Scheme.
