this section of the annual report and accounts describes the role and composition of the remuneration Committee established 
by the Board, the Company's remuneration policy and the arrangements currently in place for remuneration of both Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors. 
Unaudited Information
the Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration policies of the Company are in line with the proposals set out by the secretary of 
state for Business and Enterprise as part of the recent review of executive remuneration conducted by the Department for Business 
innovation & skills (Bis ). among the more prominent objectives set out in that consultation exercise were that: 1) Directors should 
not be rewarded for failure; 2) incentives for senior management should be more closely linked to performance, thus aligning better 
the interests of executives and shareholders; and 3) Director rewards should be correlated with those received by other employees of 
the business. the Committee believes that the Company's remuneration system conforms with these objectives whilst retaining and 
attracting individuals capable of promoting the success of the business. as the Bis consultation process is ongoing the Committee 
is monitoring developments in this area and will continue to adopt best practice wherever possible.
the Committee believes that it has met these objectives for the period to 30 March 2012 in the following ways:-
 	 Base pay: all employees are eligible for an annual pay award. the average salary increase during the year under review for all 
employees of the group was 2.9%, and the average base salary increase for Executive Directors was 1.7%.
 	 Bonus: Of the group's 9,375 employees, 6,500 employees are eligible for a bonus payment based on customer satisfaction . 
Customer satisfaction is measured independently by calling 35 customers selected at random for each of our 172 branches on 
a quarterly basis to ask them to rate key areas of service. in the past year 5,226 employees received a bonus payment. Of the 
remaining employees, 1,174 are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency targets at 
the site at which they are employed. 1,200 employees (excluding the CEO) are eligible for a bonus based on increasing group 
EBitDa year on year. 
 	 long term incentives : 2,517 employees are in the 2011 sa YE scheme and 900 have PsP options. Both schemes provide rewards 
which are based on increasing equity value. the high number of employees participating in these schemes is a testament to the 
group's policy of ensuring that the remuneration of senior management is aligned with that of the overall workforce and with the 
interests of shareholders. since 2007 when we completed the reverse takeover of Blueheath and became admitted to trading 
on aiM, the equity value has increased from approximately  300m to over  1,100m. the value of the PsP options awarded has 
been equivalent to 2% of the value generated.
alignment between the senior management and shareholders is also significantly increased by personal shareholdings. Directors, 
senior managers and colleagues own in aggregate approximately 10% of the issued share capital of the Company.
the Committee is of the view that, when the above schemes are looked at in combination, we have a structure of reasonable base 
pay, bonuses which are paid for increasing cash profit and customer satisfaction and long term incentives which are aligned to the 
creation of shareholder value. Director pay inflation is running in line with employees, the best paid Director basic salary is circa's 36 
times the basic salary of the median employee and the average basic salary of the Executive Directors is circa 23 times the basic 
salary of the median employee. 
the Committee believes that this remuneration system is simple to understand, has a proven track record of encouraging strong 
performance, does not reward failure  and reflects the Company's goals of continuing to improve services to customers and to 
create value for shareholders. Booker group plc

The Remuneration Committee
Membership 
During the year under review, the Committee comprised until 18 May 2011 Karen Jones (Chairman), lord Bilimoria, andrew Cripps 
and richard Farr. since 18 May 2011 the Committee has comprised Karen Jones (Chairman), lord Bilimoria and andrew Cripps. 
all members of the Committee are considered to be independent Non-Executive Directors. richard rose, Chairman, and Charles 
Wilson, Chief Executive, attend committee meetings by invitation. Details of attendance at committee meetings during the year 
under review are set out on page 12.
Role of the Committee 
the remuneration Committee advises the Board and makes recommendations to it:
 	 on the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and senior executives including remuneration, incentives and other benefits;
 	 on the terms of service contracts with Executive Directors and senior executives and any compensation arrangements resulting 
from the termination of an Executive Director or senior executive's service contract; and
 	 concerning share incentive plans. 
the Committee's responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference, which are published on the group's website. 
in determining remuneration, the Committee consults where appropriate with the Chief Executive about its proposals. None of the 
Directors participate in discussions about their own remuneration. No external consultants were engaged in relation to the design 
of remuneration packages during the year. When setting its remuneration policy the Committee gives due consideration to the 
provisions and principles of the Code. 
the remuneration Committee met a total of five times in the year under review and addressed the following key initiatives during 
the year:
 	 performed an annual review of the executive and employee bonus arrangements; 
 	 assessed executive performance against target and recommended Executive Directors' and senior managers' annual bonuses;
 	 reviewed executive remuneration in light of the group's wider business;
 	 implemented remuneration policy for senior executives and employees;
 	 reviewed and recommended awards under the employee share plans; and
 	 approved the disclosures in this report.
Remuneration policy 
the Committee' s overall policy is to provide competitive and rewarding remuneration packages. the Company wishes to attract, retain 
and motivate the right Executive Directors and senior management. accordingly, the Committee's policy, in a competitive market, 
is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and senior employees fairly for their individual contribution. 
in determining remuneration, consideration is (and was, in respect of the year under review) given to reward levels throughout the 
organisation as well as in the external employment market. t he average salary increase during the year under review for all employees 
of the group was 2.9%, and the average base salary increase for Executive Directors was 1.7%.
Executive Directors' remuneration 
the remuneration package of the Executive Directors includes the following elements: 
 	 Basic 	 salary	
Details of the Directors' remuneration are set out on page 23. salaries are normally reviewed annually taking into account individual 
performance, prevailing market conditions, group profitability, recent pay awards in the group generally and external benchmark 
data. any changes are effective from 1 april. salaries effective from 1 april 2012 are set out on page 21.
 	 Bonus	
Payments under the annual scheme are based upon year on year improvement in EBitDa. No bonus is paid unless there is 
an improvement in the EBitDa for the Company on an annual basis. Payments to Directors are based upon a percentage of 
basic salary and do not form part of pensionable earnings. Jonathan Prentis, Mark aylwin, guy Farrant and Bryn satherley have 
each been awarded a bonus as set out on page 23. Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, does not participate in the bonus scheme, 
but the Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arises from his significant 
shareholding in the Company. 20

Executive Directors' remuneration continued
the bonus scheme covers Executive Directors, senior managers, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 
1,200 employees of the group. the aggregate bonus pool is determined each year by the level of improvement in group EBitDa 
year on year. the maximum bonus achievable for an individual is 100% of basic salary assuming all performance targets are 
achieved. it is the policy of the Committee to ensure that targets for individual employees are sufficiently challenging to promote 
performance, and in line with this policy the average bonus paid was 9.7% of salary for the year under review. the performance 
targets for Executive Directors and senior employees are set each year.
 	 Shar e 	 incentives
the Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the PsP and the sa YE schemes. Details of awards and the value of each 
award made to the Executive Directors under the sa YE and the PsP schemes are set out later in this report. 
 	 Pensions	
the normal retirement age for Executive Directors is 65. all Executive Directors are entitled to a pension contribution at the rate 
of 15% of pensionable pay to be paid into their own personal pension arrangement or the group defined contribution personal 
pension plan, which is open to all permanent employees. Pensionable pay is set at the prior year's basic salary. During the period 
a salary sacrifice arrangement was introduced for the group Personal Pension scheme in order to maximise benefits available to 
the scheme's members. Details of pension contributions in relation to the Executive Directors are set out in the table on page 23.
 	 Other 	 benefits	
Benefits for Executive Directors comprise critical illness cover, permanent health cover, car (or car allowance), life cover of four 
times basic salary, private medical insurance and permanent health insurance for themselves and their families. 
External appointments 
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold directorships or offices of companies whose shares are listed on a recognised stock 
exchange and, accordingly, no Executive Director serves as a Non-Executive Director of any such company.
non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment
the Non-Executive Directors are paid a fixed fee and have letters of appointment for an initial period of 3 years subject to termination 
on one month's notice. in addition, the Code requires that all Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election annually. Non-Executive 
Director appointments are also subject to the articles of association of the Company. the table below summarises the dates of 
appointment and most recent re-election dates for the Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors serving as at 30 March 2012.

Executive Directors' service contracts
the Board's policy is that service contracts of Executive Directors should provide for termination by the Company on not more than 
twelve months' notice. the service contracts of each of the current Executive Directors provide for such a period of notice. None of 
the contracts provides for specific contractual termination payments other than payment in lieu of notice, and it is the Committee's 
policy to ensure that a Director's duty to mitigate his loss is taken into account in the calculation of any termination payments.
the Company's approach to the termination of contracts of service of Executive Directors is dictated by the relevant events, bearing 
in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the Company. 
the table below summarises the service contracts of the Executive Directors.
Copies of the service contracts will be available for inspection at the Company's registered office during business hours and at the

Sums paid to third parties 
No consideration was paid to third parties for making available the services of any person as a Director of the Company during the year. 
Directors' Share Interests 
the beneficial interests in the Ordinary shares of the Company of Executive Directors who held office at the end of the financial 
year are set out in the Directors' report. the Committee sets shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors. the current guideline 
is to build and maintain, over time, a personal (and/or spousal) holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least the 
Director's annual base salary. the Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines, as shown in the table to the Director's report.
Performance Graph
the Company's performance from 4 June 2007 to 30 March 2012 measured by total shareholder return ( tsr'), is compared in 
the chart below with the performance of the FtsE 250 index (excluding investment trusts) and FtsE aiM all share index. these are 
considered the most appropriate indices against which to measure performance following the reverse acquisition of Blueheath in 
June 2007, which was at that time listed on aiM, the Company's admission to listing on the Official list and to trading on the london 
stock Exchange plc's main market for listed securities in July 2009 and its inclusion in the FtsE 250 index in December 2009. 
tsr is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over a 
period of time. assuming dividends are reinvested into the Company's shares, it measures the percentage growth in the Company's 
share price together with any dividends paid.

Executive Directors and the fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors (other than in respect of Charles Wilson, Chief 
Executive and guy Farrant, Managing Director - UK Cash & Carry) were below the market median of comparator companies and 
were increased, in line with that data, from October 2010.

(c)
 the options were exercised on 18 January 2012, on which date the closing mid market price of a Ordinary share was 74.25p.
*  at the time of exercise, to the extent that there is a gain on the Cs OP option (which is a tax-approved option granted under the Ps P 
with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares at the time of grant), PsP options will be forfeited to the same value.
in 2008, the Company made awards under the PsP in relation to a total of 36.5 million new Ordinary shares. as at 25 March 2011, 
all four share price targets had been met. all of the shares vested in July 2011.
the maximum award permitted under the PsP is 400% of base salary. in practice, annual awards have been made at up to 150% 
of base salary.

to 84.65p.
PSP options 
the Committee established a Performance share Plan (the  PsP') in July 2008, which was extended on a discretionary basis to 
certain employees only. Certain information relating to the PsP was set out in the remuneration report contained in the Company's

PSP options granted in 2010
in October 2010, the Company made awards under the PsP in relation to a total of 11.3 million new Ordinary shares. 
the options granted will vest and become exercisable three years from the date of the award subject to continued employment and 
the performance conditions mentioned below being satisfied and will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of award. the 
Directors believe that the most appropriate indicator of performance of the Company and its Directors is its share price performance.
a quarter of each option will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 60p, 62.5p, 70p and 90p, in each case sustained over a 
consecutive 60-day period. as at 30 March 2012, three of the four share price targets had been met.
in October 2010, guy Farrant was granted a special performance share award (in the form of a nil-cost option) over 3.9 million 
Ordinary shares in the Company ( the Option'). the Option was granted specifically in connection with guy's appointment as a 
Director. additional information about the Option can be found in the Company's 2011 annual report and accounts which was 
approved by shareholders at the Company's annual general Meeting in 2011. 
the Option is in two parts: one part relates to 2.1 million Ordinary shares in the Company and the other part relates to 1.8 million 
Ordinary shares in the Company. a third of the 2.1 million shares will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 52p, 56p and 
58p. this part of the Option can be exercised in three annual instalments, assuming that the relevant share price target has been 
reached by the end of each year (otherwise, the Option can be exercised after three years to the extent that the targets have 
subsequently been reached by that time). as at 30 March 2012, all three of the three share price targets had been met. a quarter of 
the 1.8 million shares will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 60p, 62.5p, 70p and 90p. t o the extent that these share price 
targets are met, this part of the Option can be exercised after three years. For each part of the Option, each share price target has 
to be sustained over a consecutive 60 day period in order for the relevant part of the Option to vest. Other than as set out above, 
the vesting and exercise terms applying to the Option are the same as if it had been granted under the PsP . as at 30 March 2012, 
three of the four share price targets had been met.
PSP options granted in 2011
in November 2011, the Company made awards under the PsP in relation to a total of 7,037,960 new Ordinary shares. 
the options granted will vest and become exercisable three years from the date of the award subject to continued employment and 
the performance conditions mentioned below being satisfied and will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of award. 
the Directors believe that the most appropriate indicator of performance of the Company and its Directors for the purposes of the 
PsP is the Company's share price performance.
a fifth of each option will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 85.80p, 89.40p, 100.10p. 128.70p and 153.00p, in each case 
sustained over a consecutive 60-day period. as at 30 March 2012, none of the five share price targets had been met.
SAYE 
the Committee established in July 2008 a savings related share option scheme (the  sa YE'), as approved by HM revenue & Customs, 
which was offered to all employees within the group. Certain information relating to the sa YE was set out in the remuneration report 
contained in the Company's 2008 annual report and accounts which was approved by shareholders at the Company's annual 
general Meeting in 2008. Options under the sa YE are exercisable three years from the commencement of the relevant savings 
contract and not more than six months thereafter. these incentive arrangements reward participants if shareholder value is created, 
thereby aligning the interests of Executive Directors and employees with those of shareholders. 
Options granted under the sa YE on 3 July 2008 at a price of 18.68 pence per share vested on 1 september 2011. at the date 
of vesting the Company's share price was 70.00 pence. the average amount saved by the Company's employees was  96 per 
month which therefore delivered a gain of  9,900 at the date of vesting. a subsequent grant of options was made under the sa YE
