DireCtOrs' remuneratiOn repOrt
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority (together the Regulations). The report also describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance 
relating to Directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
of the Company at which the financial statements of the Company will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' remuneration report and to state whether, 
in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended). The report has therefore 
been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee's principal responsibility is to determine the remuneration of both the Company's Executive Directors and its senior 
management within broad policies agreed with the Board. In addition, it reviews the remuneration policy for the Company as a whole. The remuneration 
of the Non Executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors and the Chairman, not the Committee.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Remuneration Committee were finalised in two formal meetings during the year, but these were preceded 
by several informal discussions, including some with advisers (none of whom had any other connection with the Company). The members of the Committee 
were David Mann (Chairman), Nick Prest, Jonathan Brooks and Philip Dayer. 
The Chief Executive (Richard Longdon) is invited to submit recommendations to the Remuneration Committee and both he and the members of the 
Committee take into consideration relevant external market data as well as the reviews of remuneration for employees of the Group generally.
Remuneration policy 
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that members of the Executive management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced 
performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group. It also aims for a combination 
of fixed and variable payments, benefits and share based awards that will achieve a balance in incentives to achieve short and long term goals. 
The Remuneration Committee has access to detailed external research from independent consultants and during the year engaged Hewitt New Bridge Street 
to review the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management and to benchmark their remuneration against comparable companies' 
remuneration. Hewitt New Bridge Street do not provide other services to the Group. 
In 2008 the Board introduced the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008 (the Deferred Share Scheme) for Executive Directors 
and selected employees incorporating a deferred bonus component. Subject to the achievement of performance conditions relating to a single financial 
year, these incentive arrangements are intended to reward the recipient partly in cash, payable on announcement of interim and/or final results, 
and partly in ordinary shares in the Company to be delivered on a deferred basis under the Deferred Share Scheme. 
Under these incentive arrangements, depending on the extent to which performance conditions are achieved, an overall bonus amount is determined. 
Part of this overall bonus amount is payable in cash; an amount equal to the balance (which may be up to 50%) is used to calculate the number of 
ordinary shares which the bonus recipient is eligible to receive on a deferred basis. This is calculated by identifying the number of ordinary shares 
which could be purchased with the balance at the mid market closing price of an ordinary share on the dealing day immediately preceding the 
preliminary announcement of the Company's results for the relevant financial year.
An Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) was established on 10 July 2008 following shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting. Awards of deferred 
shares are made by the trustee of EBT using shares purchased in the market. The awards, which take the form of nil cost options, will normally deliver 
the deferred shares to participants in three equal tranches, one in each of the three years following the year in which an award is made by the EBT. 
These awards are made solely in respect of performance in the financial year immediately prior to their grant. Delivery of the deferred shares is not 
subject to further performance conditions provided that the participant remains an employee or Director of the Group. If the participant ceases to be 
an employee or Director, entitlement to all outstanding tranches would fall away unless the cessation occurs by reason of his or her death. Following 
the death of a bonus participant, or on a takeover, reconstruction or amalgamation, or voluntary winding up of the Company, the period for which the 
participant must remain an employee or Director would be reduced below the normal three years and entitlement to delivery of the shares would be 
accelerated. There are no arrangements for the delivery of additional matching shares to a participant in any circumstances.
The Board believes that these incentive arrangements more closely align the interests of Executive Directors and employees with shareholders' interests.
The individual components of the remuneration packages offered are:
Basic salaries/fees
It is the policy of the Committee to pay base salaries to the Executive Directors taking account of the nature and scale of the business of the Group, 
the performance of the individual in achieving financial and non financial goals within his areas of responsibility and comparable market data.
In 2008/09 both Executive Directors received basic salary increases of 5% based on advice received on their overall remuneration package from 
Hewitt New Bridge Street and in consideration of other pay awards made across the Group.
Fees for the Chairman and the Non Executive Directors are determined taking account of the individual's responsibilities, time devoted to the role 
and comparable market rates.
Benefits
Executive Directors are provided with a Company car or a mobility allowance and a fuel allowance. Non Executive Directors do not receive any benefits. 34 AVEVA Group plc Directors' report Annual report 2009

Bonus payments
The Executive Directors participate in annual performance related bonus arrangements determined by the Committee. The arrangements are based 
substantially or entirely on the performance of the Group as a whole geared towards exceeding internal and external expectations of normalised profit 
before tax with 10% based on achievement for the six months to 30 September and 90% on the full year results. 
For the annual performance bonus arrangements for 2008/09, the targets were set after considering the Group's budgeted normalised profit before 
tax and market expectations. The budget was agreed based upon objectives which were considered to be appropriate and stretching against the background 
of a profit before tax of  45 million achieved in the prior year and market conditions prevailing at that time. For 2008/09, the maximum bonus amount 
which an Executive Director could earn was 100% of basic salary. Performance targets were achieved in full resulting in a cash bonus equal to 
60% (2008 - 58%) of basic salary with the remaining 40% (2008 - 42%) of the bonus amount being used to calculate the number of deferred 
shares for which each Executive Director was eligible.
Pensions
During the year, the two Executive Directors (Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor) were members of AVEVA Solutions Limited's defined benefit pension 
scheme. It is a contributory, funded, occupational pension scheme registered with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and, since 1 October 2004, 
Career Average Revalued Earnings benefits apply. Under this scheme they are entitled to a pension on normal retirement, or on retirement due to 
ill health, equivalent to two thirds of their pensionable salary provided they have completed (or would have completed in the case of ill health) 
25 years' service. A pension earnings cap (in line with historic HMRC's earning cap) applies to Paul Taylor when calculating pensionable salary. 
Similarly, a scheme specific earnings limit applies to the benefits earned by Richard Longdon. A lower pension is payable on earlier retirement after the 
age of 50 by agreement with the Company and subject to HMRC guidelines. Pensions are payable to dependants on the Director's death in retirement 
and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service. No other Directors were members of a pension scheme during the year (2008 - nil).
Share awards
The Remuneration Committee considers that periodic grants of share related incentives should constitute an important element of the remuneration 
of the Company's senior Executives, in line with common practice in comparator companies. The Company's share schemes have therefore been used 
to provide long term incentives to assist in creating and sustaining growth in share value. There are three schemes in existence, the AVEVA Group plc 
Executive Share Option Scheme (the ability to grant shares under this scheme has now expired), the AVEVA Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan and the 
AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007. No awards have been made under the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 and 
the performance conditions that would apply to them remain to be determined. The number of shares which may be allocated on exercise of any options 
granted under any of the Company's share option schemes (including employee schemes) shall not, when aggregated with the number of shares which 
have been allocated in the previous ten years under these schemes, exceed 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately 
prior to that date. The share schemes are used to provide incentives to Senior Managers as well as Executive Directors. As recipients of these awards, 
Executive Directors and Executive Board members are required to hold or use the schemes to build share ownership with a value of at least 100% of 
their then current salary. Details of the awards made under these schemes are as follows: 
2004/05 awards
In 2004 the Remuneration Committee commissioned a study by Deloitte LLP to review the Company's share option schemes and to make recommendations 
on their development. The Board accepted those recommendations and, following consultation with shareholders, the Company established the 
AVEVA Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which was approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting held in 2004. Under the LTIP, options 
are granted to selected individuals to acquire ordinary shares at an exercise price equal to the nominal value of the shares; these options will 
be exercisable only if stringent performance criteria are met.
In 2004/05, a total of 63,000 options were awarded to Executive Directors under the LTIP . The condition of exercise for these awards was based on the ranking 
of the Company in terms of its total shareholder return measured against the techMARK 100 Index. The options  vested' in accordance with the following scale:
Total shareholder return ranking     Percentage vesting of shares subject to option
75% and above     100%
Median to 75%     Pro rata on a straight line basis
Median     33%
Below median     Nil
The performance conditions were measured in accordance with the terms of the grant and all awards vested in full.
2005/06 awards
In 2005/06, a total of 162,816 options were awarded to Executive Directors under the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme. This Scheme was 
established in 1996 at the time of the Company's listing on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange and at the Extraordinary General Meeting in 2004 
the shareholders approved the extension of its dilution limits so that further awards could be made under the scheme. The Remuneration Committee felt 
that such awards made as market value options were better suited than those under the LTIP to the Company's circumstances in 2005/06. The performance 
conditions required to be achieved for the exercise of the option was that Earnings per Share (EPS) in the financial year ending 31 March 2008 would have 
grown to no less than 5% above the Retail Price Index per annum from that achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2005. The performance condition 
was judged to be appropriately stretching because of the investment planned in the VNET programme during the period.
The performance conditions were measured in accordance with the terms of the grant and all awards vested in full.
2006/07 awards
In 2006/07 a total of 42,588 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP. The Committee decided to revert to this scheme, 
with performance conditions based on growth in EPS, but in this case the average growth in EPS achieved over the three years from 2006/07 to 2008/09. 
If average EPS growth is greater than 15% per annum then all of the shares shall vest. If average EPS growth is less than 7.5% per annum none of the 
shares shall vest. If average EPS growth is between 7.5% and 15% then the number of shares that shall vest will be determined by linear interpolation. 
The Remuneration Committee considered that these were challenging performance conditions in the context of the Company's budget and market 
expectations at the time of the awards. 
The performance conditions were measured in accordance with the terms of the grant and all awards vested in full. financial statements corporate governance business review

2007/08 awards
In 2007/08, a total of 18,234 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP. The performance conditions are based on average 
growth in earnings per share over the years from 2007/08 to 2009/10. If average EPS growth is greater than 11.5% per annum then all of the shares 
shall vest. If average earnings per share is less than 9% per annum then none of the shares shall vest. If average earnings per share growth is between 
9% and 11.5% per annum then the number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation. The Remuneration Committee considered 
that these were challenging performance conditions in the context of Company's budget and external expectations at the time of the awards.
2008/09 awards
In 2008/09, a total of 17 ,929 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP. The performance conditions are based on average 
growth in earnings per share over the years from 2008/09 to 2010/11. If average EPS growth is greater than 14% per annum then all of the shares shall 
vest. If average earnings per share is less than 10% per annum then none of the shares shall vest. If average earnings per share growth is between 
10% and 14% per annum then the number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation. The Remuneration Committee 
considered that these were challenging performance conditions in the context of internal and external expectations at the time of the awards.
Deferred annual bonus share plan
As described above, part of the annual bonus earned by Executive Directors in the year is used to determine eligibility for an award of deferred shares 
under the Deferred Share Scheme.
On 15 July 2008 the EBT awarded 12,262 and 7 ,923 deferred shares to Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor respectively in respect of the bonus arrangements 
for the year ended 31 March 2008. 
Following the achievement of the objectives for 2008/09, it is anticipated that 22,487 and 14,508 deferred shares will be awarded to Richard Longdon 
and Paul Taylor respectively in respect of the bonus arrangements for the year ended 31 March 2009. 
Total shareholder return performance graph
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the presentation of a performance graph of total shareholder return compared with 
a broad equity market index for a period of five years. The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder return, 
compared with the performance of the techMARK All Share Index. Total shareholder return is the share price plus dividends reinvested compared 
against the techMARK All Share Index, rebased to the start of the period. 
Total shareholder return v techMARK All Share Index 2004-2009
The Directors consider the techMARK All Share Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index includes AVEVA Group plc.
Service contracts
The service contracts and letters of appointment of the Directors include the following terms:
  Date of Date of Expiry/review Notice period 
  contract appointment date (months)
Nick Prest 10 January 2006 11 January 2006 11 January 2012 3
David Mann 17 May 2000 8 June 1999 Rolling 3
Jonathan Brooks 12 July 2007 12 July 2007 12 July 2010  3
Philip Dayer 27 December 2007 7 January 2008 7 January 2011 3
Richard Longdon 28 November 1996 28 November 1996 Rolling 12
Paul Taylor 17 October 1989 1 March 2001 Rolling 9
The Committee considers that the notice periods of the Executive Directors are in line with those in other companies of a similar size and nature 
and are in the best interests of the Group to ensure stability in senior management. 
There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive or Non Executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of office. 
The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for considering the circumstances of the early termination of an Executive Director's contract 
and determining whether in exceptional circumstances there should be compensation payments in excess of the Company's contractual obligations. 36 AVEVA Group plc Directors' report Annual report 2009
