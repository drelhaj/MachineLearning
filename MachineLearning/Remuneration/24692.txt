 Remuneration Committee report
Background
This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the regulations ).
The auditors are required to report on the auditable  part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of
the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the regulations). The
report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
The Board has reviewed the Group's compliance with the Combined Code (the Code ) on remuneration related matters. 
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.
Part 2 of the regulations - unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises Mrs Victoria Mitchell (Chairman), Mr David Howell and Mr Tony Palmer
all of whom are Non-executive Directors and independent. The Remuneration Committee members have no personal
financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross
directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role described. 
A copy of the terms of reference can be downloaded from the Company's website. During the year in question the
Remuneration Committee formally met three times. 
The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year and continues to be advised by Halliwell Consulting, an
independent executive compensation and share scheme consultancy. No other services were provided to the Company 
by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
In determining the Executive Directors' remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the Group
Managing Director, Mr A W Pidgley and the Group Finance Director, Mr R C Perrins. No Director played a part in any
discussion about his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy overview
The objective of the remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives. The Remuneration
Committee believes that shareholders' interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on
performance-related pay. Emphasis on performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business
strategy. It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the policy provides meaningful incentives to Executives and
ensures that the appropriate balance between fixed and performance-related compensation is maintained. 
The policy is to set the main elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration package against the following quartiles in the
Company's comparator group:
Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in kind Share incentives
Upper decile Upper decile Lower quartile to median Market practice Upper decile
For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Remuneration Committee uses the following comparator group
of companies:
Company Name
Amec plc Carillion Plc McCarthy & Stone Plc Ultraframe plc
Balfour Beatty Plc Crest Nicholson Plc Persimmon Plc Westbury Plc
Barratt Developments Plc George Wimpey Plc Redrow Plc Wilson Bowden Plc
Bellway Plc Marshalls Plc Taylor Woodrow Plc
Bovis Homes Group Plc McAlpine (Alfred) Plc Travis Perkins Plc
The Remuneration Committee reviews the policy on an annual basis to ensure that it is in line with the Company's objectives
and shareholders' interests.

Balance between fixed and variable performance based pay
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance based pay for each Executive Director
for the year ended 30 April 2006:
The Executive Directors hold no external appointments. 
The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described below. 
Elements of Executive Directors' remuneration
Basic salary
Policy: Upper decile - Salary Freeze 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2006
Year ended 30 April 2006
In accordance with the three year salary freeze no rises were made during the year. 
Policy
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that the salaries of the Executive Directors should be set at the upper decile
in line with the Committee's view that the Company has one of the most experienced Executive teams within the sector.
When determining the salaries of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration:
  the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly
similar size and complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group;
  the performance of the individual Executive Director; 
  the individual Executive Director's experience and responsibilities; and
  the pay and conditions throughout the Company.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in May 2006 at the end of the three year
salary freeze period in light of the factors set out above. As a result of the review the Remuneration Committee felt that it
was appropriate to increase the salary of the Group Finance Director of the Company. No rises were made for the other
Executive Directors.

Annual performance related bonus
Policy: Upper decile bonus potential
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to set the maximum annual bonus potential at the upper decile in relation 
to the comparator group. Bonus payments are not pensionable.

87482 Ann.Report 28-47  7/8/06  14:18  Page 32 www.berkeleygroup.co.uk 33
General
The theoretical maximum bonus available is 300% of salary. However, the Remuneration Committee will only in very
exceptional circumstances, outside the normal operation of the bonus plan for the year in question, consider a bonus
payment greater than 200% of salary. On the occurrence of very exceptional circumstances and prior to any commitment 
to make a bonus payment, the Remuneration Committee would consult shareholders to obtain their agreement that the
circumstances gave rise to the level of bonus payment proposed. Therefore, the effective maximum annual bonus potential
is 200% of salary. The maximum bonus potential and the effective maximum bonus potential remain the same for the
financial year ending 30 April 2007 i.e. 200%.
Bonus targets are reviewed each year and agreed by the Remuneration Committee. The performance measures for the
Executive Directors' bonus plan are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the
current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging. 
The structure of bonus payments is as follows:
Position Percentage cash Percentage Units
Executive Bonus will be paid in cash up to Any bonus payment above 100% of salary
a maximum of 100% of salary. will be invested, net of tax, in Units. These 
Units will be retained by the Executives for 
18 months.
Year ended 30 April 2006
The targets for the year ended 30 April 2006, their level of achievement and the corresponding bonus earned for the
Executive Directors are set out in the following tables:
Bonus potential and targets for the years ended 30 April 2006 and 30 April 2007
The following table shows the maximum bonus potential for each of the Executive Directors for the years ended 
30 April 2006 and 30 April 2007. In addition, the table shows the percentage of that maximum bonus potential subject to
each performance target for the financial year ending 30 April 2006 and for the future financial year ending 30 April 2007:

Bonus performance criteria
Cash redemption condition 
This performance condition applies to 100% of the maximum bonus potential for the Group Executive Directors and 25% 
of the maximum bonus potential for the Divisional Executive Directors. 
For years ending 30 April 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011, the cash redemption condition requires the returns of capital of  5,
 2,  2 and  3 per Unit respectively.
87482 Ann.Report 28-47  7/8/06  14:18  Page 33 Remuneration Committee report continued
For years ending 30 April 2006, 2008 and 2010, the cash redemption condition will be met if the dividend lock up tests
1
are satisfied at the end of the relevant financial year (six months earlier than required). If these tests are satisfied it means
that the Company is on target to be able to make the redemption payments on the due dates. If the dividend lock up tests
are not achieved at the end of the relevant financial year but the Board is of the view that they will be satisfied in time to
make the next redemption payment on the relevant date, this element of the bonus will be accrued and not declared until
the redemption payment has been made. In the highly unlikely event that a bonus is paid but the due redemption payment
is not made the share element of the bonus paid shall be forfeited and the cash element paid shall be offset against future
bonus entitlements.
The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the dividend lock up tests have been satisfied as at 30 April 2006. 
In forming this opinion the Committee has in part relied on the fact that the satisfaction of the dividend lock up tests has
been independently verified. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee has agreed the bonus payments set out above which
are subject to the satisfaction of this performance condition.
Divisional PBT performance condition
The divisional PBT targets are set at the beginning of the financial year at a level which is challenging taking into account 
the potential level of bonus payments, the market, development availability and other relevant issues. The Remuneration
Committee confirms that the annual bonus payments set out within this report for the Divisional Executive Directors are
appropriate taking into account the level of profit achieved and the targets set at the beginning of the year ending
30 April 2006.
Share incentives
Policy: Upper decile
Overview
Executive Directors
The only Executive share incentive plan operated by the Company is The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) Long-term
Incentive Plan (the 2004(b) LTIP ) approved by shareholders at the AGM on 17 September 2004. 
The Executive Directors, excluding the Executive Chairman, in accordance with the rules of the 2004(b) LTIP were granted
one award on the adoption of the Plan. Therefore, no awards have been granted to the Executive Directors during the
financial year ended 30 April 2006 under the 2004(b) LTIP or any other share based arrangement. Further, no awards will 
be made under the 2004(b) LTIP or any other share based arrangement during the financial year ending 30 April 2007.
Other senior employees of the Company
The Company's business is broken down into a number of operating Divisions. The Remuneration Committee considered
the annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for other senior employees of the Company linked to
the performance of the relevant Division for which they work that are implemented by the Board. Some elements of the
cash bonus plans are annual whilst other elements are deferred to ensure long-term consistent delivery by each Division. It
is the view of the Board that these arrangements are much more targeted at ensuring the delivery of Divisional performance,
for which these senior employees are responsible, than a share based plan which by its very nature would be subject to
Group performance. It is the view of the Board that ensuring that senior employees are focused on the delivery of Divisional
results is the most effective way of driving shareholder value. 
2004(b) LTIP main features
The Plan provides for Executive Directors, excluding the Executive Chairman, with rights to receive, at no cost, the shares
set out in the table below. The number of shares awarded under the Plan was determined on 26 October 2004, the date 
of the Scheme of Arrangement, as 15% of the fully diluted share capital of the Company on adoption of the 2004(b) LTIP.
The shares will only be released to the Executive Directors if the Company has returned to shareholders  12 per share by
31 January 2011, i.e. the end of the holding period. Fifty percent of the shares subject to awards will be retained by the
Executive Directors for a period of at least 12 months after the date of release, with the balance retained for a period of at
least 24 months following release.
34 www.berkeleygroup.co.uk
1
The dividend lock up tests are the additional financial ratio tests set out in the Group's banking facilities that must be satisfied for the Company to make a redemption payment.
These tests are more stringent than the ongoing financial covenant tests applicable to the Company's bank facilities.
87482 Ann.Report 28-47  7/8/06  14:18  Page 34 The following table sets out the awards made under the 2004(b) LTIP to the Executive Directors:
Name Ordinary Shares 
A W Pidgley 11,371,393
R C Perrins 4,264,272
A Carey 3,553,560
G J Fry 2,132,136
The Remuneration Committee's policy is designed to incentivise the Executive Directors to maximise the total return to
shareholders. In the Remuneration Committee's opinion this will be achieved by incentivising the Executive Directors to not
only ensure that  12 per share is returned to shareholders but also by providing them with a direct share in the residual
value of the Company. As a result, the value of the awards is directly linked to the value of the residual Company following
the return and as such there is a close alignment between the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders, both 
of whom benefit from a maximum value for the residual part of the Company. The Remuneration Committee will determine
whether the performance condition has been satisfied by ensuring the redemption payments have been made in the allotted
time frame.
Shareholding requirement
The Company has a shareholding requirement for both Executive and Non-executive Directors. 
The following table sets out the shareholding requirement and the actual shareholdings of the Executive Directors as at 
30 April 2006:

M B Tanner - 100%
Dilution
The only share plan operated by the Company is the 2004(b) LTIP. It is not currently intended to operate any other Executive
or all employee share incentive arrangements. The Company has historically operated all its share schemes within the ABI
dilution limits excluding the 2004(b) LTIP which was a unique arrangement arising from the change in corporate strategy.
There has been no dilution for the purposes of the ABI dilution limits in the year ended 30 April 2006.

Closed share plans
The following table sets out those share plans closed on the reconstruction of the Company in relation to which there are
still unpaid benefits held by the Executive Directors:
Plan Position
The Berkeley Group plc In accordance with the rules of the Plan the performance conditions were measured on 
2000 Long-term Incentive Plan the reconstruction of the Company and were found to have been satisfied. Therefore, 
Executives were entitled to the immediate release of their awards. The Executives, 
however, agreed to defer the release of these awards until their original release dates and 
for the awards to remain subject to the cessation of employment provisions in the rules. 
No further conditions apply to the awards as the original performance conditions were 
satisfied in accordance with the rules of the Plan on the reconstruction.
The Berkeley Group plc 2000 The Group Managing Director was the only Executive Director to have unvested options 
Share Option Plan on the date of the reconstruction. On the reconstruction his options vested and the 
Group Managing Director chose to take the conditional compensation payment
2
alternative 
offered to all holders of unvested options under the Plan.
2
The conditional compensation payment is equal to the difference between the share price of the Company over the ten business days prior to the reconstruction becoming effective
and the exercise price of the relevant option multiplied by the number of shares under such option.
Pension
Policy: Lower quartile to median
The Executive Directors are all members of one or more of the following pensions schemes in operation within the Group,
namely The Berkeley Group Staff Benefits Plan, The Berkeley Homes Executive Pension Plan and The St George PLC
Group Personal Pension Plan (which replaced The St George PLC Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme with effect from 
1 March 2006). No element of remuneration other than basic salary is pensionable.
Three Executive Directors have benefits accruing to them under a defined contribution scheme and three have benefits
accruing to them under a defined benefits scheme. Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in these schemes.
The Company is currently in the process of reviewing all its pension arrangements (including those for Executive Directors). 
However, it should be noted that the Company is not providing any compensation to Executives for loss of tax relief as a
result of the change in legislation on 6 April 2006 (A-Day ).
Details of pension costs for Executive Directors are set out in the audited section of the report on page 39.
Benefits in kind
Policy: Market practice
In line with market practice, the Company's policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional benefits:
  a fully expensed company car; and
  medical insurance.
Other remuneration matters
All employee share schemes
The Board of the Company has consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating Divisions. 
The consensus view was that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving annual cash bonuses based on the
performance of their respective Divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share scheme. The Board,
therefore, did not believe it was in shareholders' interests to incur the income statement and dilutive cost of share
arrangements which would not have the desired effect on employees. Accordingly, the Company has introduced
appropriate annual bonus arrangements in all of its Divisions and is not intending to implement any employee 
share schemes.

87482 Ann.Report 28-47  7/8/06  14:18  Page 36 Non-executive Directors' fees
Policy: Upper decile fees
All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the
limits set by the articles of association. The 2006 fee levels are based on a specific survey of the fees paid to Non-executive
Directors in the comparator group by Halliwell Consulting. The following table sets out the fee rates for the Non-executive
Directors in the year ended 30 April 2006:

M Tanner was appointed on 1 September 2005. Therefore his fees for the year ended 30 April 2006 have been annualised for comparison purposes.
The Board decided to increase the fees of the Non-executive Directors for the year ended 30 April 2006 in light of the
following factors:
  the increasing workload and level of responsibility of the Non-executive Directors under the changing corporate
governance expectations of shareholders and their representative bodies; and
  the current market rate for fees for Non-executive Directors. The Board has been made aware of the market rates for
Non-executive Directors during its recent recruitment exercise resulting in the appointment of M Tanner.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Company's share incentive schemes or performance based plans
and are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme. 
Executive Directors' contracts
The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations. The only event
on the occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on
cessation of employment; with the maximum payment being 12 months' salary. No payment is due on either a Company
takeover or in the event of liquidation. In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss. Further, the
Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure. None of the Executive Directors'
contracts provides for liquidated damages. There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors'
contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company. Further, there are no special
provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Director's cessation of employment with the Company.
Non-executive Directors' agreements
All non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon
retirement by rotation as required by the Company's articles of association. All letters of appointment for Non-executive
Directors are renewable annually on 1 May.

Performance graph
The graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder return (TSR ),
4
compared with the
performance of the FTSE250, the FTSE All Share and the Company's remuneration comparator group (as set out on
page 31). The Company considers these the most relevant indices for total shareholder return disclosure required under 
the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.

Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) - is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the measurement period (the return is the value of the capital gain
and reinvested dividends). This calculation is then carried out for the relevant Indices and constituents of the Comparator Group.

recognise the very significant time she spent during 2004 discharging her duties as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. This was far in excess of that normally associated
with the position and required Mrs Mitchell to forego other work and consulting opportunities during this period. The Board of Berkeley consulted with major shareholders over this
payment and thought it appropriate to make the payment in shares.

calculation of accumulated accrued pension entitlements above.
The above Directors are non-contributory members of the Plan. A W Pidgley was a contributory member of the Plan 
until February 2006. The change in transfer value during the year for Mr Pidgley, excluding contributions paid by him, 
is  237,595.

The transfer values of the Directors' accrued benefits under the Defined Benefit Plan, as set out above, are calculated in
accordance with the  Retirement Benefits Scheme - Transfer Values (GN11)' published by the Institute of Actuaries and the
Faculty of Actuaries. The transfer values disclosed above represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need
to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the liability in respect of qualifying services. As such they represent 
a potential liability of the pension scheme. These transfer values do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual
Director and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration. Members of the fund have the option to pay
additional voluntary contributions; neither these contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the transfer values 
in the table above.
In addition to the above, the Company made the following contributions to defined contribution plans:

(1) The participants received the share element of the 2001 awards during the year. Following the Group reconstruction, share elements of the awards were converted into awards
over Units in The Berkeley Group Holdings plc. On the release of the share element of these awards, the participants received Units in respect of the share awards granted as well
as the  5 repayment attached to those Units, which had been held in trust until their release on 7 August 2005. The participants received the cash element of these awards
during FY2005.
(2) As explained on page 36, on approval of the Group reconstruction on 25 October 2004, the Remuneration Committee determined that the performance conditions relating to the
2002 and 2003 awards had been satisfied. The participants received the cash element of the 2002 award during the year, and will receive the share element of the 2002 award
during FY2007. They will receive the cash element of the 2003 award during FY2007, and the share element of the 2003 award during FY2008. All the share elements of the
awards were converted into awards over Units in The Berkeley Group Holdings plc. On the release of the share element of these awards participants will receive Units as well as
any redemption payments attached to those Units, which will be held in trust until the relevant release dates.
The mid-market share price of the Company on 7 August 2001 was 725.5p, on 19 August 2002 was 665.0p, on 22 July

* The beneficial interests in Units (each Unit comprising one Ordinary Share of 5p, one 2004B share of 5p, one 2006B share of 5p, one 2008B share of 5p and one 2010B share of
5p) at 1 May 2005 relates to Units in the Company of 20p (after the redemption of the 5p 2004 B share). This disclosure is unaudited, but included in this table for the convenience
of the readers of the accounts.
The mid-market share price of the Company was 770.0p as at 1 May 2005 and the mid-market share price of the
Company was 1,151p as at 30 April 2006. The mid-market high and low share prices of the Company were 766.0p and
1,211.0p respectively in the year.
At the date of this report, the interests of A W Pidgley in the Ordinary Share capital of the Company have increased by
35,946 Units to 1,603,726 Units, the interests of A Carey have increased by 8,866 Units to 290,844 Units, the interests of
R C Perrins have increased by 15,576 Units to 57,938 Units, the interests of G J Fry have increased by 239 Units to

Following the Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement on 25 October 2004, the Scheme triggered the rights of
participants to exercise options under the Group's share option schemes which would not otherwise have been exercisable.
Under The Berkeley Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 (the 1996 Scheme ), The Berkeley Group plc 2000
Approved Share Option Plan (the 2000 Approved Plan ) and The Berkeley Group plc 1994 SAYE Share Option Scheme 
(the SAYE Scheme ), there were no further options outstanding at 1 May 2005, and no further grants will be made under
these schemes.
Aggregate gains made by Directors on the exercise of share options in the year amounted to  nil (2005:  125,397).
Under The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Share Option Plan (the 2000 Plan ), Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement, 
in accordance with the Plan's rules, resulted in immediate vesting of options under the Plan without reference to satisfaction
of the performance conditions unless the Remuneration Committee deemed otherwise. The Remuneration Committee
determined to offer all participants with options the opportunity of either exchanging options for options over Units after the
reconstruction, or of releasing their options in consideration for a conditional cash payment. The basis of calculation of this
compensation payment is explained on page 36 and will only be provided if the participant is an employee of the Company
at the original vesting date for the option. Mr Pidgley chose the conditional compensation payment in respect of these
options. The conditional cash payments are set out in the table below:
Options Conditional 
Original option released Option 1 May Paid 30 April compensation

The average mid-market share price of the Company over the ten business days prior to the release date of 28 October
2004 (the date on which the corporate reconstruction became effective) was 1,208.2p.
