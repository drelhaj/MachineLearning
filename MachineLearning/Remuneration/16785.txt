3. Directors' remuneration policy 
The remuneration policy of the Company aims to:
  provide alignment between remuneration 
and the Company's business objectives;
  attract and retain high calibre directors;
  motivate directors to achieve challenging
performance levels;
  recognise both individual and corporate
achievement; and
  align executive rewards with shareholder value.
The total remuneration of executive directors
comprises base salary, annual and long-term
incentives, pension provisions and other
benefits. 
Following a detailed review of the total
remuneration package of executive directors
and other senior executives in 2006, it was
agreed that a substantial element of executive
compensation should be  at risk' in order to
reward and drive increased performance,
reflect the market trend and to align better 
the interests of executives with those of
shareholders. The proportion of variable pay 
to fixed pay has increased over the past few
years and now stands at around 2:1 for
executive directors. 
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed in relation to median
market data for comparable companies in 
terms of size, market sector and complexity.
Other considerations are individual experience,
performance and scope of responsibility. 
Base salaries are normally reviewed on an
annual basis or following a significant change 
in responsibilities. 
Annual performance bonus
Each executive director is eligible to participate
in an annual cash-based bonus scheme with
payments based on the achievement of
stretching financial targets and personal
performance against individual short and
medium-term objectives. Adjusted operating
profit and working capital financial targets are
set by the Remuneration committee at the
beginning of each financial year. In 2006/7 
the scheme provided an incentive opportunity
for executive directors in the range 0% to 
100% of base salary, with an expected value of
around 53% for  on target' performance. This
annual bonus scheme will continue unchanged
for 2007/8.
Long-term incentives
The Associated British Foods Executive Share
Incentive Plan 2003 ( the Share Incentive
Plan') was established following shareholder
approval at the 2003 annual general meeting.
Under this scheme, long-term awards are
made in the form of a conditional allocation 
of shares which are released if, and to the
extent that, performance targets are satisfied
over a specified three year period.
The first allocations to executive directors and
other key executives were made in December
2003 and shares to meet these obligations were
acquired in the market. The maximum face
value of the allocation for executive directors 
was 150% of base salary, with no expectation 
of further allocations being made during that
three year performance period. Awards were
subject to testing, in September 2006, against 
a pre-determined operating profit target range
modified by return on capital employed, and
subject to a further performance hurdle whereby
no awards would be made to participants if
earnings per share were below RPI + 4% per
annum on average over the three year period 
of the plan. Shares under this award vested in
December 2006 and are included in the table
on page 41.
As a result of the detailed review of total
remuneration undertaken in 2006, revised
incentive plan arrangements were introduced in
September last year. It was agreed that executive
directors should be granted an annual allocation
of conditional shares thus creating a series of
overlapping three year performance periods. 
The first allocations under the new arrangements
were made in November 2006. These grants, 
to a maximum face value of 125% of base
salary, relate to the three year performance
period September 2006 to September 2009.
Performance under this plan will be measured
against a range of 5% to 11% compound annual
growth in adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted
earnings per share was chosen as the measure
for long-term incentives as it is transparent 
and easily understood both by participants 
and shareholders. 
As the first of the new three year long-term
incentive plans will not mature until December
2009, arrangements have been put in place for
the two interim years which will be settled in
cash in December 2007 and December 2008.
The Remuneration committee has set interim
adjusted earnings per share targets for 2006/7
and 2007/8 which are milestones towards the
adjusted earnings per share target set for 2009.  Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2007 41

In line with the policy outlined above, it has
been agreed that the second allocation of
conditional shares under the new arrangements
to a maximum face value of 125% of base salary
will be made on or after 21 November 2007.
The committee has reviewed the performance
criteria and has determined that this allocation
will again be measured against compound
annual growth in adjusted earnings per share,
in the range of 5% to 11% at the end of the
performance period in September 2010.

medical insurance, life assurance, home and
mobile telephone costs and the reimbursement 
of reasonable business expenses. The taxable
value of these benefits is included in the table 
of directors' remuneration below. 5. Directors' pensions 
The Remuneration committee aims to ensure
that retirement benefits are in line with best
practice standards adopted by major companies
in continental Europe and the UK. 
In accordance with this policy, executive
directors are covered by final salary, defined
benefit arrangements and can retire at their
normal retirement age with retirement benefits
broadly equivalent to two thirds of final

pensionable salary. The Company pension
schemes are HMRC approved but the executive
directors also have entitlements under employer
financed arrangements which are unregistered. 
Directors' pension disclosure for year ended 
15 September 2007
The table below shows the defined 
benefit pension entitlements from the
Associated British Foods Pension Scheme 
(the ABF Scheme), and unfunded unapproved
arrangements where appropriate, of executive
directors of Associated British Foods plc who
were members of the ABF Scheme during the
year ended 15 September 2007.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values increased as follows during the year:

Notes:
1.Pension accruals (A) and (C) are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of year or earlier retirement. 
2.The pension values (E), (F) and (G) are transfer values calculated in accordance with version 9.2 of guidance note GN11 issued by the 
actuarial profession.
3.The value of net increase in pension (E) represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the year, resulting from
additional service and increases in salary. It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) after deducting the director's contribution
during the year (D).
4.The change in the transfer value (H) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and
directors, such as stock market movements. The director's contributions during the year (D) are excluded from this value.
5.Both directors opted out of the ABF scheme on 5 April 2006 and since then have earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement Benefit
Scheme (EFRBS). The figures shown represent the aggregate of benefits in the ABF scheme and the EFRBS.
6.Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
7.Pension benefits include a 50% spouse's pension. Pensions are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with RPI, limited each year to 5%.
Additional discretionary increases to pensions in payment have been granted in the past. 6. Directors' share options
There are two schemes under which both HMRC approved and unapproved options may be granted:
  The Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme (the 1994 Scheme) requires options granted to be held for five years before they become
exercisable, at which point they are not subject to any performance criteria; and
  The Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme (the 2000 Scheme), under which options granted become exercisable by
participants after an initial three year performance period, to the extent that performance criteria have been satisfied. Performance criteria are based
on robust levels of business performance over the period. 
Although share options may continue to be granted on a selective basis, it has been agreed that share option awards will not form part of the normal
ongoing remuneration package for executives.
The number of share options held by the directors under the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme were as follows:

8. Directors' service contracts 
It is the Company's policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts with 12 month notice periods. The Company's Articles of Association require
that all directors retire from office at every third annual general meeting. Details of the contracts of service of directors who served during the year ended
15 September 2007 are set out below:

*Jeff Harris resigned as a non-executive director on 18 April 2007.
The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with the ultimate
holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited. He receives no fees for performing his role as a non-executive director
and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred by him in that role.
The committee takes the view that the entitlement of the executive directors to the security of 12 months' notice of termination of employment is in line
with the practice of many comparable companies. 
The Remuneration committee's aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation. The
Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the Combined Code regarding inclusion of explicit
provisions in directors' service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination. The committee will continue to keep under
review its current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to particular circumstances. 
9. Directors' beneficial interests
The directors of the Company as at 15 September 2007 had the following beneficial interests in the shares and debentures of the Company, its holding
company and fellow subsidiary undertakings.

In addition to the above, George Weston and John Bason were allocated a conditional grant of shares under the Share Incentive Plan, details of which
are shown on page 41.
The interests shown above remained the same as at 6 November 2007. 10. Non-executive directors
The board reviews non-executive directors'
fees periodically in the light of fees payable
in comparable companies and the importance
attached to the retention and attraction of
high calibre individuals as non-executive
directors. Fees are paid on a per annum
basis and are not varied for the number 
of days worked. The chairman of the 
Audit committee and the senior independent
director are paid an additional fee. Non-
executive directors do not participate in the
Company's annual or long-term incentive
plans and take no part in any discussion 
or decision concerning their own fees. 
It has been agreed that adjustments will 
be made to the fees in December 2007
following a period of two years in which 
the fees have remained unchanged. 
11. Executive directors serving as non-
executive directors
The Remuneration committee has determined
that executive directors serving as non-
executive directors of other companies may
retain any fees earned. 
During the year, George Weston served 
as a non-executive director of Wittington
Investments Limited, for which he received
no compensation. 
12. Compliance statement
In compliance with the UK Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, 
the auditable part of the Remuneration report
comprises directors' remuneration on page 41,
directors' pensions on page 42, long-term
incentives on page 40, directors' share options
on page 43 and directors' beneficial interests
on page 44.
