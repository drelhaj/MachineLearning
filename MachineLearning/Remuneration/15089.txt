Directors' remuneration report
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, The Companies Act 2006 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The report addresses the following key elements:
  Membership of the remuneration committee
  The remit of the committee and its work in 2009
  The company's remuneration policy on executive pay
  Disclosure of the directors' remuneration arrangements and remuneration received during the year
  Details of the operation of annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes
1. Membership of the remuneration committee
Membership of the committee comprises exclusively non-executive directors of the company all of whom (with the exception of
Sir Richard Broadbent only by reason of his chairmanship of the Board) are considered to be independent.
The committee is chaired by Nick Buckles and the other members are Angie Risley, Simon Batey and Sir Richard Broadbent. 
With the exception of Angie Risley, whose membership of the committee commenced on 22 April 2009, all members served on the
committee for the year under review. The committee met six times during the year; details of each member's attendance record are
disclosed in the Board and Board committee attendance table which appears on page 99 in the corporate governance report.
Committee meetings are also attended by the chief executive (except for those items relating to any aspect of his remuneration) and
on occasions by Alison O'Connor, director - human resources. The company secretary acts as secretary to the committee.
2. Remit of the committee
The remuneration committee is responsible for all aspects of remuneration as they affect the executive directors and the most
senior level of management below the Board. Detailed terms of reference, which appear on the company's website,
www.arriva.co.uk, are well established and are periodically reviewed and amended as necessary. During the year the company
received independent advice and support from T owers Watson.
The key responsibilities of the committee are:
(a) Determining and agreeing with the Board and keeping under review a remuneration policy for both directors and senior
management.
(b) On the basis of proposals put forward by the chief executive, having consulted the chairman, determine the remuneration
packages of the executive directors, and all others where the total remuneration package (including pension and bonus)
exceeds a value to be determined by the Board from to time; consider any proposals for the introduction of new pension
arrangements, including the termination of any existing material arrangement, and make recommendations to the Board.
(c) Agreeing targets and benefits in respect of any executive performance related pay scheme having due regard to the interests
and expectations of the shareholders and ensuring that targets set are sufficiently challenging and that the rewards represent a
fair and highly motivating incentive and are commensurate with industry/ peer pay comparator group practice.
(d) Agreeing and keeping under review the pension benefits for each executive director and all others where the total
remuneration package (including pension and bonus) exceeds a value to be determined by the Board from time to time.
(e) Regularly reviewing and assessing the executive remuneration policies and structure of the pay peer comparator group 
and making appropriate recommendations to the Board having due regard to the practices adopted by the peer pay
comparator group.
(f) Reviewing annually the composition of the peer pay comparator group to ensure it remains appropriate.
(g) On a regular basis critically evaluate the merits and effectiveness of the company's performance related pay schemes,
including the introduction of new share incentive schemes, and make appropriate recommendations to the Board.

Directors' statements
(h) At its discretion and having consulted with the chief executive, appoint and agree the terms of reference and the
remuneration of any external consultants who may from time to time advise the committee.
(i) Approving the directors' remuneration report for subsequent approval by the Board. 
3. Remuneration policy
It is the responsibility of the remuneration committee to set the remuneration of the executive directors and senior executives in
accordance with the broad policy established by the Board. The main thrust of the Board's remuneration policy is to establish
and operate a compensation framework which is conducive to the recruitment and retention of high calibre directors and senior
managers for the benefit of the company's shareholders. Considerable emphasis is placed on performance-driven compensation
where targets are aligned with the company's strategic objectives and targeted shareholder returns. In setting the framework for
remuneration the committee has regard to the pay levels and structures operating within FTSE 250 companies from the transport
and other sectors which comprise the peer pay comparator group established by the committee. Reference is also made by the
committee to pay arrangements operating within its UK-based direct competitors.
4. Remuneration review
As reported last year the committee had concluded, following an extensive review based upon independent advice from T owers
Watson, that basic salary levels for its executive directors were materially out of line with the base salary levels at peer group
companies whether broadly or narrowly defined. It concluded at that time that The committee is clear that it is not in the interests
of the company to continue indefinitely paying salaries to its senior executives that are well below the median of its competitors
and its peer group. It intends therefore as a matter of policy to seek to close the gap that has developed as quickly as possible. 
The committee determined, after consultation with shareholders and mindful of the need to strike a balance between internal
priorities and the general economic climate, to approve only modest increases in base salaries.
In considering the pay review for 2010 the committee remains mindful of the continuing difficult economic conditions and the
general level of interest and concern over executive salaries. T aking this, as well as the continuing mismatch of salaries into
account, the committee concluded that it would again be appropriate to implement modest increases in the base salaries of the
executive directors with effect from 1 January 2010 as follows:
Base salary Increase Base salary
1 Jan 2009 1 Jan 2010
  
David Martin 494,000 4% 514,000
Steve Lonsdale 328,000 4% 341,100
Steve Clayton (retired 22 April 2009) 288,000 N/A N/A
It does however continue to be the committee's objective to ensure that executive salaries are aligned as quickly as possible with
the median position within the company's peer pay comparator group, as indicated in last year's remuneration report. Directors' remuneration report (continued)

5. Remuneration structure
(a) Base salary
Each of the executive directors is paid a basic annual salary which is reviewed on 1 January each year. The salaries of the
executive directors were increased effective from 1 January 2010 as detailed in section 4 above.
(b) Performance-related bonus
Each of the executive directors has the opportunity to earn additional remuneration under a performance-related bonus scheme;
this opportunity is capped at a maximum bonus of 100 per cent of base annual salary. Of the bonus potential, 70 per cent is
driven by group financial performance and 30 per cent by personal performance against a number of qualitative objectives
agreed with each director at the beginning of each year. With regard to the financial performance element, the structure for 2009
was as follows:
(i) Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) (maximum of 50% of base salary)
Bonus as % of base salary at 1 January 2009
 160m 0
 180m 20
 210m 50
(ii)   Earnings per share (EPS) (maximum of 20% of base salary)
Bonus as % of base salary at 1 January 2009
48p 0
53p 8
61.5p 20
EPS excludes goodwill impairment, intangible asset amortisation and exceptional items. EBIT includes the contributions from
associate companies but excludes unbudgeted acquisitions and exchange rate movements.
The qualitative element continues to focus on specific aspects of strategy including financing, rapid response to adverse market
conditions, pensions, property and the continued development of a high calibre management team supported by a robust
succession plan.
On the basis of the definitions above, adjusted EBIT for the year ended 31 December 2009 was  163.1 million and adjusted EPS
for the year was 57.6 pence. This, together with the performance of the directors against their personal performance targets gave
rise to bonus payments as follows:
2009 2008
  
David Martin 222,794 375,360
Steve Lonsdale 140,000 239,300
Steve Clayton retired on 22 April 2009 and was paid a bonus of  48,960 in respect of 2009 (2008:  209,200).
The non-executive directors do not participate in the performance-related bonus scheme.

(c) Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP is a share-based plan and comprises a conditional award of shares of a value equivalent of 200 per cent of the executive
director's basic salary as at 1 January preceding the date of an award; awards are normally made each March following the
announcement of the group's preliminary results for the preceding financial year.
Awards comprise a blend of two elements with each element providing the opportunity for each executive director to earn up to one
half of the conditional share award. Each element operates as follows:
(i) T otal Shareholder Return element (TSR)
This element provides the opportunity to earn up to one half of the initial total conditional award and is based on the group's
TSR performance when ranked against the TSR performance of those companies comprising a  peer comparator group'. For
this purpose the peer comparator group consists of companies (excluding the company and investment companies) whose
shares comprise the FTSE 250 at the beginning of each three-year measurement period.
Performance is measured over three consecutive financial years (1 January - 31 December), the first year of the measurement
period being the year in which the conditional share award is made. In order for shares to vest under this element, the TSR
performance of the group must achieve, as a minimum, the median TSR performance of the peer comparator group;
achievement of the median position will generate the vesting of 25 per cent of this element of the award, and this will increaseon
a linear basis to 100 per cent of this element on the achievement of upper quartile performance.
The TSR performance is independently calculated and verified by Alithos Limited.
(ii) The EPS element
This element also provides the opportunity to earn up to one half of the initial conditional award; vesting of the shares is on
a linear scale with 10 per cent vesting if EPS increases to a level which is four per cent per annum in excess of the increase in
the Retail Price Index (RPI) over the three-year measurement period; vesting will increase on a linear scale to a maximum of 
100 per cent of this element on EPS performance achieving or exceeding 13 per cent per annum in excess of the growth in RPI.
The vesting of the shares conditionally awarded in 2007 had as the performance measurement period the three years ended
31 December 2009. The TSR over the period did not achieve the threshold for vesting and therefore this element of the award
lapsed with no benefit arising.
With regard to the EPS element of the conditional award, EPS for the year ended 31 December 2009 was 58.8 pence compared
with EPS for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 44.4 pence, an annualised increase of 9.82 per cent. The annualised growth
in RPI over the same three year period was 2.46 per cent, resulting in a vesting of this element of the conditional award of 
43.6 per cent.

2007 3 years ended 31 December 2009 March 2010
2. For awards made before 2006 vesting was dependent on the performance of the group's EPS when compared with the growth
in RPI and also the TSR of the group when compared to that of a peer comparator group (comprising the constituent companies
of the FTSE 250 excluding the company and investment companies). The degree of vesting was on a sliding scale of 25 per cent
to 100 per cent with no shares vesting unless the company's TSR was at least equal to the median TSR of the peer comparator
group. However, irrespective of TSR performance, vesting of the awards in any event was subject to the growth in the company's
EPS exceeding the growth in RPI by at least six per cent over the measurement period.
3. For awards made in 2006 and subsequently, the performance targets have been separated into two distinct elements, TSR
and EPS, with both elements capable of delivering vesting of up to 50 per cent of the total award without being subject to
mutual dependency.
The company operates share retention guidelines which require each executive director to retain 50 per cent of any vested shares
until such time as a holding equivalent in value to basic annual salary has been achieved.
The non-executive directors do not participate (and have not participated) in the LTIP . 
Changes in the interests of the executive directors in conditional share awards made under the LTIP in the year ended 
31 December 2009 were as follows:

Directors' statements
With effect from 1 December 2009 a change to the future pension accrual terms under the Arriva Passenger Services Pension Plan
(the Plan), of which David Martin is an active member, was implemented. The change introduced a freezing of pensionable salary
for all active members for a period of four years to be followed by the capping of future pensionable salary increases to a maximum
of one per cent per annum. The capping of pensionable salary will continue until the technical provisions deficit under the Plan is
certified by the actuary to have been eliminated.
David Martin has the opportunity to elect to take an annual cash sum, paid monthly in arrears (on a basis that is cost neutral to
the company), in lieu of any future pension accrual. No future executive director external appointees to the Board will be eligible
for a final salary-based pension arrangement, but instead will receive a cash contribution equal to 25 per cent of basic salary.
(h) Service contracts
Each of the executive directors has a service contract dated 19 April 2006; the contracts are subject to 12 months' notice from the
company and six months' notice from the director. Each contract contains covenants restricting the ability of the director, within a
period of six months from termination, from competing with the company. The contracts make specific provision with regard to
termination payments which are quantified as the sum of:
(i) The directors' basic pay at the date of termination;
(ii) The amount of bonus estimated to be payable in respect of the year in which notice is served, but in any event capped at a
maximum of 40 per cent of basic pay; and
(iii) The value of the benefits in kind.
Additionally, in the case of termination by the company, the company will seek to procure that the director is credited with an
additional 12 months' service in his respective pension scheme.
Should the director terminate the contract within six months of a change of control of the company he will receive a termination
payment equal to 50 per cent of the termination payment described above.
(i) External Board appointments
The Board generally supports executive directors accepting one appointment outside the company. Before accepting such
appointments the director(s) involved must receive the prior approval of the Board. In considering such cases the Board will
always satisfy itself that such appointments will not detract from the executive directors' expected contribution to the company, nor
that such appointment will create any conflict of interest; any fees earned by an executive director in such a capacity will be
assigned to the company. Neither of the executive directors currently holds an external directorship appointment. Directors' remuneration report (continued)
