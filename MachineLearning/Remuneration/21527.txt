adopted the principles of good governance as set out in the Combined Code and complies 
with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the relevant schedules of the 
Companies Act and the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations, 2002 ( the 
Regulations'). The Board's view as to the independence of the members of the Committee is 
discussed further in the Corporate Governance section of the Directors' report on page 42. 
The report is divided into audited and unaudited information. The Regulations require the 
Company's auditors to report that the  Audited information' in this report has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Regulations. 
The Remuneration report will be submitted for shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting on 9 July 2009.  
Overview 
During the year to 31 March 2009, Babcock continued the strong performance seen now 
for several years, maintaining strong cash flow and reducing net debt.  
Management is tasked with continuing this performance in the coming year and over the 
longer term. This will be against the backdrop of a general environment which, at least in the 
medium term, looks set to remain uncertain and difficult. Management will seek to meet the 
challenge by, amongst other things: 
  continued development and implementation of appropriate strategic plans that address 
the short and longer term risks, needs and changing environment for Babcock as it 
continues to increase in size;  
  preserving, improving and building upon Babcock's existing strengths and customer 
relationships;  
  positioning Babcock for expansion into new business and customer markets where the 
Group's core skills can be exploited; 
  building strategic alliances that will further those expansion plans; 
  addressing decisively any areas of business weakness; 
  ensuring that good management succession planning for the medium and longer term  
is in place and that Group-wide management training meets the needs of Babcock's 
increasing size and the challenges it faces; and 
  securing continued order book growth by building on Babcock's performance record, 
improving bidding processes and enhancing customer satisfaction.  
The Committee's approach to setting the structure of remuneration packages for executives, 
including the proposals for changes, described in this Report is designed to underpin the 
effective and proper management of these risks and challenges and to reward executive 
management fairly if it is successful in continuing the track record of strong performance  
and long-term growth prospects enjoyed by Babcock and its shareholders over recent years. 
The Committee believes that this is achieved by: 
  increasing the emphasis on performance-related rewards, particularly in the form of  
share-based incentives that align management interests more closely with shareholders 
and ensure that they are exposed to the longer term impact (both risks and benefits)  
of their decisions; 
  greater use of non-financial measures in bonus plans; and 
  ensuring that total remuneration for superior performance is adequately competitive.  
The following sections of this Report explain the implementation of this approach more fully.

How the Committee operates 
The Committee meets formally  
at least three times a year. The 
Committee also meets on an ad 
hoc basis as may be necessary. 
The Company Secretary attends 
meetings as secretary to the 
Committee. The Group Chairman 
and the Chief Executive attend 
formal meetings by invitation  
of the Committee, except when 
their own remuneration is being 
discussed. The Deputy Chairman 
attends some meetings as  
an observer. 
During the year, the Committee 
received advice from Kepler 
Associates ( Kepler'), who 
succeeded the Inbucon Group 
Limited ( Inbucon') as the 
independent executive 
remuneration advisers to the 
Committee in December 2008. 
The choice of Kepler to advise it 
was made solely by the Committee 
(after a formal selection process 
conducted by the Committee that 
involved several potential advisers). 
Kepler is formally retained, with the 
Committee's approval, by the 
Company (acting through the 
Company Secretary). Neither 
Kepler nor Inbucon provide or 
provided other services to Group 
companies (except in connection 
with remuneration advice). 
What is the Company's remuneration policy? 
The Committee strongly believes that the remuneration of executives should dovetail with  
the key strategic objectives of the business and be aligned with the long-term interests  
of shareholders. The link between remuneration policy and strategy is made through the 
performance criteria used in both the annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes.  
The Committee's intention is that executives have remuneration packages overall that are  
fair and allow enhanced and fair rewards for the delivery of superior performance. It is the 
policy of the Committee not to fix high base salaries. Given this, the other components of  
the remuneration package need to provide significant competitive upside opportunity.  
2008/09 review 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the Company's executive remuneration practices to 
ensure they are achieving the objectives of the Company's remuneration policy. The outcome 
of that review as it affects annual bonus and longer term incentives is described more fully in 
the following sections of this Report.  
In formulating its proposals for remuneration structure from 2009, the Committee was 
conscious of the economic backdrop and the need to link pay to both the short- and  
long-term success of the Company. Despite recent economic circumstances, Babcock has 
continued to deliver strong EPS growth and TSR performance. It is clear to the Committee  
that the reward opportunities for Babcock executives have lagged behind the Company's 
growth. The Company is seeking to provide a more competitive upside opportunity for 
stretching levels of performance consistent with the objectives of the remuneration policy.  
A key objective of the revised incentives is to align the Directors' interests more closely  
with shareholders' long-term interests. To this end the Committee proposes to increase the 
emphasis on performance-related pay and long-term incentive opportunities by increasing the 
reward opportunities for superior performance, but without increasing rewards for  average'  
or  median' performance. For example, under the proposed TSR performance target for  
awards to be made in 2009 under the proposed new Performance Share Plan ( PSP'), vesting  
at threshold for the element of the award to which it applies would be reduced from 25% 
(as currently applies under existing L-TIP awards) to 16.7% so that, despite the increased 
incentive opportunity under that plan for superior performance, the same percentage  
of salary would be paid for around median performance as would have been paid under 
the L-TIP. At the same time, the proposed longer term EPS target for 2009 PSP awards will 
be made more stretching. Similarly, whilst increasing the scope for performance-related 
annual bonus, the Committee is imposing in the current financial year a requirement on 
Executive Directors and certain senior managers for mandatory deferral of a significant 
part (40%) of any future annual bonus earned into shares (no such deferral was previously 
required). The new bonus arrangements will also include a significant element attributable 
to non-financial performance metrics to ensure better linkage to Babcock's strategic 
objectives and management of longer term risks.

Balance of remuneration 
The balance of remuneration for Executive Directors is such that the major part of overall remuneration is subject to achieving 
performance conditions over both the short and long term. The reward mix for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director is 
shown in the charts below, with long-term incentive awards being valued on a fair value basis. The charts assume that the 
proposals for a new Performance Share Plan (PSP) are approved by shareholders at the Company's forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting in July and that PSP awards over shares have a value on grant equal to 150% of the Director's basic salary. The charts  
are based on fair values of 72% of salary for the annual bonus (including the mandatorily deferred share element now being 
introduced as described below) and 59% of salary for the proposed Performance Share Plan. 
 
Note: Based on remuneration proposals for 2009. 
Internal relativity 
The Committee is sensitive to the need to set Directors' remuneration having regard to pay and conditions in the Group as  
a whole and is satisfied that the approach taken by the Company is fair and reasonable in light of current market practice and 
the best interests of shareholders.  
Basic pay 
Basic pay is considered in the context of total remuneration at companies that are comparable in terms of size, market 
capitalisation, revenues and number of employees and other companies in the support services sector. Against these data 
sources taken as a whole, the Company's total remuneration fair value is around the median and basic pay is below median. 
Basic pay is normally reviewed annually.  
The normal annual review of Executive Director's pay for the year commencing 1 April 2008 resulted in an increase of 4%. For 
the current year commencing 1 April 2009, the Committee has limited the annual increase to approximately 2% as follows: 
Director 
Basic pay 
at 1 April 2009 
 '000 
Basic pay
at 1 April 2008
 '000
P L Rogers (Chief Executive) 479.5 470.0
W Tame (Finance Director) 312.0 305.5
Performance-related rewards 
Annual bonus schemes 
Annual bonuses for 2008/09 were based on profit, cash flow performance and earnings per share growth, and were up to a 
maximum of 100% of base salary for Executive Directors. (The Committee decided to bring Mr Tame's bonus potential into line 
with Mr Rogers', by increasing it from 80% to 100%, effective from 1 April 2008.) 
The annual bonuses payable to Mr Rogers and Mr Tame were structured as follows: a bonus of up to 20% of salary was 
dependent on hitting budgets for profit before tax and operating cash flow. The balance of 80% of salary depended on growth 
in earnings per share, which was calculated before amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items, with maximum 
pay-out for this element being achieved at 20% year-on-year growth. 
Mr Rogers and Mr Tame earned maximum annual bonus for the financial year 2008/09 and, in accordance with past practice, 
this is to be paid in full in cash.  
Following its remuneration review and to meet its framework for remuneration as described above, the Committee has 
increased the maximum bonus opportunity for 2009/10 for Executive Directors from 100% to 150% of base salary. However,  
at the same time, the Executives will be required to defer 40% of any annual bonus earned (i.e. worth up to 60% of salary if the 
maximum bonus is awarded) into Babcock shares for two years. For the financial year 2009/10 the Committee will set annual 
bonuses for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame principally by reference to achieving budgets (20% of bonus opportunity), growth in 
earnings per share (before amortisation of acquired intangibles, but, unless the Committee otherwise decides, after exceptional 
items) (60% of the bonus opportunity), with maximum bonus only for year-on-year growth of 20% or more. In addition, the bonus 
for 2009/10 will include within the performance requirements (accounting for up to 20% of the total bonus opportunity) key  Governance 34 - 60 
Babcock International Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
51
non-financial metrics that are directly related to the Group's key strategic objectives, risk factors and management challenges 
described in the  Overview' section on page 48 above.  
It is the Committee's intention to provide rewards that are fair to both executives and shareholders. In light of this, and 
consistent with current investor sentiment the Committee will commit to review the ongoing financial impact of any prior  
year activities, and the role of individual executives in such activities, and may make appropriate adjustments to future  
individual bonus awards to reflect material new information or circumstances that might later have emerged from or about 
those activities. 
Annual bonus schemes for divisional managing directors and certain senior Group executives will in future also provide for 
increased maximum bonus potential also with a requirement for deferral of 40% of any bonus earned into Babcock shares for 
two years. For divisional Managing Directors the schemes for 2009/10 will include performance measures dependent on growth 
in divisional profits and/or achievement of budgeted divisional profits and cash flow according to the objectives for the division 
concerned and will have non-financial metrics forming a significant part (20%) of the bonus opportunity.  
The Committee has discretion to reduce or extinguish bonuses in light of health, safety or environmental performance. 
Annual bonuses are not pensionable. 
Long-term incentives 
Since 2003, qualifying Directors and certain senior Group employees have been granted performance-related long-term 
incentives in the form of annual awards of nil-price options under the Babcock 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( L-TIP').  
Before 2003 they were granted performance-related market-priced share options under the Babcock 1999 Approved and 
Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes. Following the 2008/09 remuneration review, the Committee is proposing, 
subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in July, to make share-based long-term incentive 
awards from 2009 onwards under a new Babcock Performance Share Plan 2009 ( PSP')   see further below.  
It is the intention of the Company that shares needed to satisfy executive options for Directors and awards under the L-TIP and 
PSP will be purchased in the market to the extent not already held in the Group's employee share trusts at the date the options 
or awards are granted or are exercised, unless it is in the interests of the Company to do otherwise. PSP awards may be granted 
in the form of nil-cost options. PSP Awards may also be combined with an award of HMRC approved options under the proposed 
Company Share Option Plan ( CSOP') (see page 37 above), in which case the PSP award would be adjusted to take account of 
the CSOP award; it is not intended that Executive Directors will receive CSOP options this year, but may do so in future years. 
Details of options and L-TIP Awards already held by Directors are set out on pages 56 and 57. 
During the financial year to 31 March 2009, L-TIP awards were made to each of Mr Rogers and Mr Tame over shares having  
a market value on award of 100% of their qualifying basic salaries. Awards were also made to a small number of other senior 
managers. The vesting of the L-TIP awards depends on company performance. Half of each award vests according to 
comparative Total Shareholder Return performance (against a comparator group selected by the Committee) and half on 
earnings per share (EPS) growth. The performance criteria are set out in more detail on page 58. 
For certain divisional senior managers, but not the Company's Directors, there has been a cash-based long-term incentive 
scheme focused on divisional performance and with particular features to aid retention. The performance targets under that 
scheme were set by reference to divisional profit targets and return on capital employed or operating cash flow, as appropriate 
to the division's business. A similar scheme is in place for senior Group employees (but not the Company's Directors) based on 
EPS growth over the performance period. Target awards under these cash-based schemes varied between participants but did 
not normally exceed 100% of salary for on-target performance, with maximum payout for out-performance capped at 150% of 
salary. Awards under the scheme are not pensionable. It is proposed that from 2009 this scheme will be replaced with future 
awards being made in the form of share-based incentives under the proposed PSP.  Babcock International Group PLC

Proposed PSP from 2009 
A summary of the principal features of the proposed PSP can be found in Appendix 1 to the Notice of Annual General Meeting 
(pages 115 to 118 in this document). Under the PSP, the Committee proposes to increase the maximum annual long-term 
incentive award for Executive Directors (and certain other senior executives) to 150% of salary, but with full vesting 
accompanied by a commensurate increase in the stretch in EPS performance. In exceptional circumstances (for example,  
on the recruitment of a new senior executive), awards may be made up to 200% of salary, but the Committee currently has  
no intention to grant awards of more than 150% of salary. The proposed performance metrics for 2009 PSP awards would  
be broadly the same as for recent awards under the L-TIP (subject to the increase in EPS growth requirement for full vesting 
mentioned above), with half of each award vesting according to comparative TSR performance and half according to EPS 
growth. The Committee also proposes that the peer group for TSR comparison purposes for 2009 awards be the broader  
FTSE 350 group (excluding financial services companies and investment trusts) and to calibrate performance on a percentage 
out-performance basis rather than on a ranking basis. Further, in the proposed targets for 2009 PSP awards, the Committee is 
proposing to reduce the percentage vesting at threshold for both the EPS and TSR elements from 25% to 16.7% so that the same 
percentage of salary is  paid' for achieving threshold performance as would be payable for existing L-TIP awards. The increase in 
opportunity will be fully realised only for achievement of stretch performance, for which the Committee proposes to increase 
the EPS target. The detailed proposed performance criteria for 2009 are set out on page 58. 
For certain senior Group managers and divisional senior managers, it is proposed, as mentioned above, that the cash-based 
awards under the long-term incentive schemes for them will be replaced in the future by share-based awards under the PSP.  
For divisional managers vesting would normally be determined according to divisional performance targets. For senior Group 
managers the performance targets would be as for PSP awards made to Executive Directors or other targets appropriate  
to them.  
Performance graph 
The graphs below were prepared by Kepler Associates. They show the total shareholder return for a holding in the Company's 
shares for the period from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2009 relative to a holding of shares representing respectively the FTSE  
All-Share Index (excluding investment trusts) and the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector. The calculation of the return assumes 
dividends are reinvested to purchase additional equity. This FTSE All-Share Index (excluding investment trusts) is the same index 
as has been used for this purpose in earlier Remuneration reports, as it is a broad index that allows comparison of the Company's 
performance against the performance of the stock market as a whole. Support Services is the sector in which the Company's 
share price is reported. 
Over the five-year period, the Company has substantially out-performed both indexes. An investment of  100 in the  
Company on 1 April 2004 would have been worth (assuming the dividends were reinvested in further Company shares)  
 417 at 31 March 2009.

Notes: 
1. Mr Turner's remuneration includes fees at the rate of  35,000 per annum from 1 June to 31 October 2008 and thereafter at the rate of  250,000. 
 The comparative remunerations for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame for the year to 31 March 2008 include part paid at the rate before the in-year remuneration reviews 
referred to in last year's remuneration report (and also for Mr Rogers an amount in lieu of pensions that predated the increase, in October 2007, of the pension 
supplement referred to under  Directors' pensions' below). That remuneration review resulted in an increase in basic salary of 6% with effect from 1 October 2007  
for Mr Rogers and 7% with effect from 25 June 2007 for Mr Tame. In addition, in the year to 31 March 2008, Mr Tame's bonus was 80% as compared to 100% for  
the year to 31 March 2009. 
2. Amount paid to Mr Campbell on loss of office pursuant to a Compromise Agreement entered into in connection with his leaving the Company. 
3. For Mr Rogers, the allowance is pay in lieu of all pension benefits. For Mr Tame, the payment includes  25,000 in lieu of pension benefits on that part of his basic  
salary as exceeds the earnings cap for the pension scheme (see detailed explanation under Directors' pensions below) and  11,000 in respect of expenses connected 
with accommodation. 
4. For Mr Tame, benefits comprised medical insurance, home to work travel expenses and accommodation benefits. For Mr Rogers, they comprised medical insurance. 
For Sir Nigel Essenhigh, they comprised home to work travel expenses. 
The fees for Lord Hesketh reflected his additional duties as Deputy Chairman. Mr Rennocks' and Mr Shah's fees reflected their 
additional duties as Chairmen of, respectively, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee.  
Bonus payments and benefits in kind paid to Directors are not pensionable.  Babcock International Group PLC

Directors' pensions (audited) 
Of the Directors, only Mr Tame currently participates in a Group pension scheme. He receives a salary supplement for his 
earnings in excess of the scheme earnings cap (see the table below).  
Mr Rogers receives a supplement in lieu of any pension benefits, which is not taken into account for the purpose of bonus  
or share awards. It is separately identified in the table on page 53 under  Cash allowances'. In the year to 31 March 2008  
a first step was made towards bringing the supplement up to a level closer to market practice for equivalent executives by 
increasing it from 8% to 14% of salary but which still left it significantly below market levels. As part of its 2008/09 review  
of total remuneration, the Committee has completed the move and increased the supplement with effect from 1 April 2009  
to 20% to bring it into line with market practice for senior executive directors. 
The Company's policy is to remain competitive in the marketplace to attract and retain the calibre of employee it needs.  
Subject to that, it is not the Company's policy to compensate Directors for changes to the taxation of pensions. 
Babcock International Group Pension Scheme ( the Scheme') 
Mr Tame is a member of the senior executive tier of the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme. No other Directors  
are members of the Scheme or receive pension benefits from the Group. 
The accrual rate for Mr Tame under the Scheme is one-thirtieth for each year of service, with pension being calculated on his 
base salary (up to the Scheme's  earnings cap') in the 12 months prior to retirement at age 60 or above. Membership of the 
Scheme also entitles him to life assurance cover of four times base salary up to the earnings cap. The earnings cap adopted by 
the Scheme is the same as the former statutory earnings cap, index-linked in the same way. The Company takes out additional 
life assurance cover in respect of four times his salary in excess of the earnings cap.  
Mr Tame's pension entitlements under the Scheme (defined benefit) are set out in the following table:

1. Inflation has been taken as 5% for the purposes of calculating increases in transfer values and pension earned. 
2. The transfer value of the increase in pension accrued is calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, and is stated after deducting members' 
contributions.  
3. The figures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benefits under the Scheme. 
4. The figures in the above table make no allowance for any benefits in respect of earnings in excess of the Inland Revenue earnings cap. 
5. In calculating the above figures for Mr Tame no account has been taken of any retained benefits which he may have from previous employments. 
6. No payments have been made to retired Directors in excess of the retirement benefit to which they were entitled on the date the benefits first became payable  
or, if later, 31 March 1997. 
Other pension arrangements (audited) 
Before 1 April 2006, the Company provided a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS) for Mr Tame in respect  
of his salary in excess of the earnings cap. The Company contributed to the FURBS an amount equal to 20% of the excess 
(including employer's national insurance contributions), with Mr Tame making contributions into the Company's pension 
scheme on his full uncapped salary. As from April 2006, this was replaced with a salary supplement of 15% of the excess 
(including employer's national insurance contributions), with Mr Tame contributing into the Company's pension scheme  
only on capped salary. The value of this supplement in the year to 31 March 2009 was  25,000. 
The cost of providing additional life assurance cover was:

Non-Executive Directors 
The Non-Executive Directors receive only fixed fees. These fees are reviewed against market practice from time to time by  
the Chairman and the Executive Directors, to whom the task has been delegated by the Board. Fees payable to Non-Executive 
Directors (other than the Chairman) were last reviewed in October 2006. With effect from 1 April 2009, the fees have been 
reviewed, in light of market practice at companies of a similar size and in the support services sector, and are now as follows: 
Chairman  255,000 
Deputy Chairman  60,000
Senior Independent Director  60,000
Chairmanship of Audit and Risk Committee  12,500
Chairmanship of Remuneration Committee  7,500
Basic Non-Executive Director's Fee  47,500
No additional fees are paid for membership of committees.  
Directors' interests in shares 
The table below shows the holdings of fully paid ordinary shares of 60p each of the Directors (including family interests) in the 
issued share capital of the Company. The interests were beneficial interests. 
Hitherto, the Board has encouraged Executive Directors to build and maintain, over time, a personal holding of shares equivalent 
in value to around a year's basic pay. Following implementation of the proposed changes to remuneration described elsewhere 
in this report, this will be increased to at least one and a half times salary.

* The amount by which the market value of all shares acquired on exercise exceeded the aggregate exercise price. 
Options vested according to comparative TSR performance over three-year performance periods. They were not subject to  
re-testing. The comparator group was the companies in the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector when the options were 
granted (which was the sector in which the Company's shares were then listed). There was no vesting unless the Company 
ranked above median performance, in which case 25% of the options vested. Full vesting was for top quartile ranking with 
proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis for a ranking between those points.  
The exercise price was set at the average of the mid-market closing price of the Company's shares for the three business days 
preceding the date of the grant. This price was not discounted. 
Directors must exercise vested options before the tenth anniversaries of the grant dates, or earlier if there is a change of control, 
they leave or die, failing which they will lapse.  
There were no changes in the Directors ' share options between 31 March 2009 and 20 May 2009.  Governance 34 - 60

The number of shares sold on exercise of the LTIP awards by Mr Rogers and Mr Tame were in each case just sufficient to cover 
income tax and employee national insurance charges arising on exercise, and dealing costs.  
The Remuneration Committee exercised its powers under the rules of the L-TIP to treat all of the L-TIP award made to him in 
2006 and two-thirds of the L-TIP award made to him in 2007 as having vested on Mr Campbell's ceasing to be employed on  
31 October 2008. 
The Company's mid-market share price at close of business on 31 March 2009 was 429.50p. The highest and lowest mid-market 
share prices in the year ended 31 March 2009 were 647.50p and 348.50p respectively.  Babcock International Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Remuneration report continued

The L-TIP awards that vested during the year to 31 March 2009 were those granted in July 2005. The market value of those 
shares on award was 169.50p per share. On the date of vesting, 22 May 2008, they had a market value of 597.50p per share, 
being the mid-market closing price on that day. The performance conditions attached to the awards are described below. 
All the L-TIP awards made to Directors to date have been made by the trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust as nil cost 
options. The number of shares awarded had a value equal to the Director's qualifying annual salary at the date of the award 
(using the average of the mid-market closing price of the Company's shares for the three business days' preceding that date).  
Subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria attached to LTIP awards (see below), the Directors may call for the release  
to them of the award shares during the respective exercise periods. Subject to the rules of the plan, an earlier release of  
shares under unvested awards may be allowed by the Remuneration Committee (for example, in the event of a cessation  
of employment or a change in control), but (unless the Committee otherwise decides) of not more than a time-apportioned 
proportion and then only having regard to the Company's performance, though the Committee has discretion to allow a  
greater proportion to be released. 
Performance measures attached to L-TIP awards and proposed PSP 
Performance under the L-TIP is (and would under the PSP also be) judged over the period of three financial years from the start  
of the financial year in which the award is made. Performance is measured at the end of the period and is not re-tested. 
Awards not vested as at 31 March 2009  
2005 2008 awards 
For L-TIP awards made between 2005 and 2008, half of the shares vest based on comparative TSR performance and half 
according to growth in earnings per share (EPS). For the TSR element, a ranking immediately above median results in 25%  
of those shares vesting. There is no vesting for ranking below that level. A ranking in the upper quartile results in 100%  
vesting. Rankings between these threshold levels result in proportionate vesting calculated on a straight-line basis between  
25% and 100%.  
The comparator group of listed companies for the 2005 and 2006 awards comprised AEA Technology, W.S. Atkins, Aggreko, 
Amec, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, Cobham, Interserve, Laing (John), Mitie, Mouchel-Parkman, PHS Group (dropped in 2006), 
Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group and WSP Group.  
The comparator group for the awards made in 2007 comprised AEA Technology, W.S. Atkins, Aggreko, Amec, Bodycote, Capita, 
Carillion, Cobham, Interserve, Mitie, Mouchel-Parkman, Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group, WSP Group, Weir Group, Ashtead Group, 
Alfred McAlpine and Davis Service Group. 
For L-TIP awards made in 2008, the comparator group comprises the constituents of the FTSE 350 Support Services Index as  
at the date of grant   this was a peer group in the same FTSE sector as the Company and was chosen pending the fuller review 
of longer term incentives described above. 
The TSR calculation normally uses a 12-month average for share prices adjusted for dividends paid during the period.  
The Company feels that this is the most appropriate period because a 12-month average ensures both that the short-term 
market volatility is excluded and that for each company a 12-month period will capture the impact of the announcement  
of results and payment of dividends. A shorter period would not capture all these events and would not necessarily put all 
companies on an equal footing. For the half of the 2005 2008 L-TIP awards where vesting depends on EPS growth, 25% of the 
shares vest if growth in EPS (adjusted to exclude exceptional items and acquired intangible amortisation) over the performance 
period is equivalent to a real (i.e. growth in excess of the increase in the consumer prices index) compound annual growth rate 
of 4%, with full vesting if this reaches 8%. Vesting is on a straight-line basis for growth between those two points. There is no 
vesting for compound annual earnings per share growth of below 4% (real).  
2009 awards (subject to shareholder approval of the PSP) 
For awards to be made in 2009 under the proposed PSP, it is proposed that half should vest according to comparative  
TSR performance ( the TSR element') and half according to growth in earnings per share ( the EPS element'). The Committee 
considers the use of two measures, in these proportions, to be appropriate. The TSR performance measure is dependent on  
the Company's relative long-term share price performance and so provides strong alignment with shareholders' interests.  
This is used in conjunction with EPS growth, which is the primary internal benchmark of financial performance and ties in  
with the Company's strategic goals. For the TSR element, it is proposed that the TSR sector peer group would be the broader 
FTSE 350 (excluding investment trusts and financial services) due to the fact that Babcock's closest peers straddle multiple 
sectors, not just support services, and to make the calibration more robust. The Company intends to use TSR percentage out-
performance as a measure of performance rather than a ranking. As with previous L-TIP awards, the TSR calculation would 
normally use a 12-month average for opening and closing share prices adjusted for dividends paid during the period. For both 
the TSR and EPS elements, the Committee proposes to leave threshold vesting as a percentage of salary unchanged (at what  
it was for the existing L-TIP Awards), i.e. 12.5% of salary for each element, which implies a reduced percentage of the award   Governance 34 - 60

vesting at threshold. For TSR performance at median, 16.7% of the TSR element of the award would vest. There would be no 
vesting for TSR performance below median. Out-performance of the median by at least 9% p.a. would result in 100% vesting  
of the TSR element. For out-performance of the median between 0% and 9% p.a. vesting would increase on a straight-line basis 
between 16.7% and 100%. Participants will only be entitled to a vesting of shares under the TSR element if the Remuneration 
Committee is satisfied that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying performance of the Company over  
the performance period. 
For the other half of the 2009 PSP awards, the EPS element, 16.7% of this element would vest if earnings per share growth 
(adjusted to exclude acquired intangible amortisation, but, unless the Committee decides otherwise, after inclusion of 
exceptional items) over the performance period is equivalent to a real compound annual growth rate of 4%. Real growth  
would be measured as growth in excess of the growth in the retail price index, rather than the consumer price index as used  
for previous L-TIP awards, thus bringing the Company in line with common practice. The proposed real growth target required 
for full vesting will be increased from 8% (as applied under the existing L-TIP Awards) to 11% real growth p.a. Vesting would be 
on a straight-line basis for growth between those two points. There would be no vesting for compound annual earnings per 
share growth of below 4% real.  
The Remuneration Committee will have the discretion to review the performance conditions attached to future PSP awards 
prior to the start of each cycle to ensure they remain appropriate. However, no material reduction in targets would be made 
without prior consultation with shareholders. 
The charts below illustrate the proposed vesting schedules for each element of the proposed 2009 PSP award: 
 
It is also proposed that, in common with recent market practice, the share awards would carry the right to receive on vesting 
any dividends (or, if the Committee so decides, a number of shares having a market value equivalent to the amount of the 
dividends when the dividend was paid) that would have been paid in the period between grant and vesting, but only on the 
shares that actually vest.

(Mr G Campbell, former Chairman, who left the Board on 31 October 2008 also had a service agreement with the Company 
(dated 31 July 2003 as amended by letters dated 5 May 2004 and 3 April 2006) which provided for termination by the 
Company on giving 12 months' notice or by Mr Campbell by giving six months' notice. It also contained similar provisions 
relating to termination following a change of control as are described below for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, though there was no 
right to any payment in lieu of bonus. The agreement terminated on 31 October 2008 pursuant to a Compromise Agreement.)  
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors' service contracts should be capable of being terminated by the Company  
on not more than 12 months' notice.  
If the Company terminates a Director's service contract (other than following a change of control (see below) or by the exercise 
of the Company's option to pay salary in lieu of notice) the Company will have regard to all the circumstances in determining  
the amount of compensation, if any, payable to him in connection with that termination. 
The agreements for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame contain provisions relating to termination following a change of control. Each 
contract provides that within 90 days of the occurrence of the change of control, Mr Rogers or Mr Tame (as the case may be) 
may terminate his employment forthwith. If he exercises this right, he is entitled, for a 12-month period, to be paid (on a 
monthly basis) his basic salary plus 40% (compared to a maximum entitlement under the annual bonus scheme of 150%)  
in lieu of bonus and all other contractual entitlements. From this there is to be deducted any amount that the Director receives 
by way of income, if it exceeds 10% of his Babcock salary, from other sources that he would not have been able to earn had  
he continued in employment with the Company. If the Company terminates his appointment within 12 months of a change  
of control, he would be entitled to a termination payment equal to 100% of his annual salary (plus 40% in lieu of bonus and  
all other benefits).

* The Company's policy is for Non-Executive Directors to have written terms of appointment normally for no more than three-year terms at a time; however, in all cases 
appointments are terminable at will at any time by the Company or the Director.  
The latest written terms of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office and at the Company's 
Annual General Meeting. The expected time commitment of Non-Executive Directors is set out in their current written terms  
of appointment.  
Outside directorships 
Before taking up any new outside appointment, an Executive Director must first seek the approval of the Chairman. Any fees  
for outside appointments are retained by the Director. Mr Rogers is a Non-Executive Director of Galliford Try plc, having joined  
its board on 1 July 2008. During the year to 31 March 2009 he received  25,700 by way of fees for that role. Mr Tame is a  
Non-Executive Director of Carclo PLC. During the period 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009 his fees for that role were  26,500.
