 Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration
Introduction
The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors' Remuneration (the Committee ) within a
framework set by the Board. As at the date of this Report, the Committee's members are three non-executive directors, Mr Finn (Chairman), Mr Perry and Mr
Johnson. Mr Finn is to retire at the AGM on 16 January 2009, and he will be replaced on this Committee from 1 February 2009 by Mr Mike T oms, with Mr
T oms taking the role of Committee Chairman. None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to
be decided. There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
During the year, the Group Company Secretary attended a number of Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee and provided advice on issues
other than those relating to his own remuneration. The Committee also received independent external advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street. Hewitt New
Bridge Street was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other service to the Company other than to the Board Committee on Non-Executive
Directors' Remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors (apart from the Chairman) is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors'
Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors. The Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration also receives advice from the
Group Company Secretary and Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The Chairman's remuneration is determined by the other non-executive directors.
Objectives
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate executive
directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers. The Committee has set, as an objective, a policy of paying
remuneration around the median of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses and it is satisfied that the structure of the executives' packages will
broadly achieve this objective. The Committee has used this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the risk of upward only reviews of
remuneration. The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance related elements of remuneration (annual bonus and long-term
incentives) constitute a significant proportion of an executive's potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if demanding and stretching
performance targets are achieved. The Committee considers that the remuneration level and structure are fully competitive with the market, with a significant
element of the package payable in the form of share-based incentives, subject to long-term T otal Shareholder Return (TSR ) and Return on Capital Employed
(ROCE ) performance conditions, thereby creating alignment with the interests of shareholders.
In framing the Company's remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice provisions in the
Combined Code and the Association of British Insurers' ( ABI ) guidance.
Service contracts and letters of appointment
The executive directors have fixed-term service contracts which specify that retirement is at age 60, with a 12 month notice period on either side. For executive
directors, on termination, an amount equivalent to one year's salary, benefits and the average amount of the last two years' annual bonus payments, would be
payable. The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation of compensation payable for early termination will ensure that there is variability in the potential
level of compensation. In particular, after a period of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be payable, reducing potential payout
in these circumstances.
The notice period of all executive directors' service contracts is kept under review by the Committee. It is the Committee's view that the notice period for the
executive directors is appropriate and consistent with current market practice. The details of the executive directors' service contracts are as follows:

Salaries and fees
Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year, taking into account the general settlement across the Company. Any changes are implemented from that date.
For the year under consideration, the executive directors were awarded rises varying from 4.84% to 11.11%. These increases were considered appropriate by
the Committee after an assessment of base salary levels in peer group companies and also taking into consideration the performance of the executive directors
and of the Company as a whole.
Fee levels for non-executive directors reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and are reviewed annually, taking into account the level of fees
for similar positions in comparable companies. They are not entitled to any benefits (with the exception of the Chairman) or pension. They do not participate in
any bonus or long-term incentive plan and they are not entitled to compensation on termination of their agreements, other than normal notice provisions of
three months' notice given by either party.
Benefits in kind
Benefits in kind provided to the executive directors relate to car allowance and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus scheme
The annual bonus scheme has a potential which is currently capped at 120% of basic salary, other than in exceptional circumstances where outstanding
performance may, in the view of the Committee, merit a higher bonus, subject to an overall cap of 150% of basic salary.
Recognising the genuinely exceptional operating environment for the UK housing market and the consequent short-term lack of visibility in the outlook for
financial performance, the Committee intends to operate a less formulaic bonus structure for the forthcoming year (within the maximum cap set out above).
The basis for the payment of any bonus will be disclosed in next year's Remuneration Report.
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway shares under the terms of the
Bellway p.l.c. (2008) Share Matching Plan.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
Long-term incentive schemes
(1) The Bellway p.l.c. Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which was established in 2003, is available to all employees, including the executive directors.
(2) The Bellway p.l.c. (2004) Performance Share Plan (the PSP ) was introduced for the Company's executive directors and the Group Company Secretary.
Under the PSP , executives have been granted awards over shares worth 100% of base salary each year.
For awards made on 16 January 2008, two performance conditions applied to separate parts of the award:
(a) 50% of the award is based on a TSR condition against other housebuilders but, instead of a ranking approach (comparing Bellway's TSR to that of each
other company), an Index is created out of the TSR of the other housebuilders in the group. Bellway's TSR is compared to that of the Index.
If Bellway's TSR matches that of the Index, 25% of the TSR part of the award vests (reduced from the previous vesting profile whereby 33% of the
award vested at median). Full vesting is achieved for 7.5% per annum outperformance of the Index. The Committee has carried out significant
modelling, the results of which support the premise that 7.5% per annum outperformance is equivalent to average  upper quartile' TSR performance of
the housebuilders.
Further, regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee considers that the Company's TSR
over the performance period reflects underlying financial performance.
The companies comprising the Index for the awards in the financial year commencing on 1 August 2008 are as follows;
Barratt Developments PLC Bovis Homes Group PLC Redrow plc
The Berkeley Group plc Persimmon plc T aylor Wimpey plc
TSR is recognised as enabling alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders through providing a reward mechanism for delivering superior
stock market performance
(b) The remaining 50% of the award is based on a range of ROCE based targets requiring average annual ROCE of 15% per annum (at which point, 25%
of the ROCE part of the award would vest) to 22% per annum for all of this part of the award to vest. Awards vest on a straight line basis in between
these two points. Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration (continued)
For awards to be made in the financial year commencing 1 August 2008, in view of the difficulty in setting financial performance conditions in the current
economic climate, it is proposed that the TSR part of the award will apply as the sole performance condition. It is currently anticipated that the performance
conditions will revert to a combination of TSR and ROCE when the housing market returns to more normal conditions and clearer visibility of the
Company's prospects is possible.
The directors' outstanding awards under the PSP are set out in the table on page 38.
(3) Shareholder approval was given at the AGM in January 2008 for the introduction of a new long-term incentive plan, the Bellway p.l.c. (2008) Share
Matching Plan (the SMP ) to operate in conjunction with the annual bonus plan.
Under the SMP senior executives may invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus, on a voluntary basis, in Bellway shares, which must be held for a minimum
of three years. Invested shares will not be subject to a risk of forfeiture and executives will enjoy full beneficial ownership (including voting rights and
dividends).
In return for investing in shares, under the SMP , an award of matching shares is granted. The level of matching is on a gross basis to the net of tax bonus
invested in shares.
Matching shares will vest subject to the executive remaining employed, retention of the invested shares and also subject to a performance condition.
For the 2008 SMP awards, the performance condition will be the same TSR-based condition as will apply to the 2008 award of performance shares. It is
anticipated that the performance condition will revert to ROCE when the housing market returns to more normal conditions and clearer visibility of the
Company's prospects is possible.
Shareholding Guidelines
There is a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors, equivalent to 100% of basic salary. As at 31 July 2008, and at the date of this report,
all executive directors hold shares with an equivalent value in excess of 100% of their basic salary. Any executive directors appointed in the future will be given an
appropriate period of time to acquire the requisite shareholding.
Directors' interests
The directors' interests (including family interests and holdings in which directors are interested only as trustees) in the ordinary share capital of the Company are
set out below:

Personal Pension (SIPP ) at 31 July 2008 and at the date of this report (1 August 2007 - 554,164). During the year Mr Leitch acquired a beneficial interest in
50,000 Bellway p.l.c. 9.5% cumulative redeemable preference shares 2014 of  1 each, which he held at 31 July 2008 and at the date of this report (1 August

Pensions
In an effort to control its long-term pension costs the Company, during the year, offered the executive directors an enhanced transfer value from the final salary
section of the Bellway plc 1972 Pension & Life Assurance Scheme. The offer was made on equal terms for each individual with the additional amount available to
be taken either as an enhancement to the standard pension transfer value, as a separate taxable cash amount, or a combination of both. The three executive
directors elected to take a combination of both. The transfer values from the pension scheme to the individual director's private pension arrangements and the
additional cash amounts received by them are set out in the table below.

A M Leitch 2,534,875 675,125 1,081,162
The transfers were all made on 31 July 2008. In addition, the three executive directors ceased to accrue future benefits in the scheme with effect from 31 May
2008. This action is considered to be beneficial as it removes an ongoing open-ended liability of the Company. The Committee received appropriate advice in
arriving at the enhancement levels and the quantum is considered to be fair given the benefit promises surrendered. In a further effort to control the cost of
ongoing pension provision the Company, in consultation with the rest of the active membership of the final salary section of the scheme, is carrying out a similar
exercise in relation to the balance of the membership of the final salary section of the scheme. As part of the consultation exercise it is proposed that final salary
accrual would terminate, to be replaced by Defined Contribution arrangements.
Further details in relation to executive directors' pensions can be found under  Directors' pension information' on page 41.

5. Market value on 7 December 2007, which was the day the shares vested was 914.0p.
6. Aggregate gross gains made by these directors on vesting of awards under the performance share plan in the year were  620,886.34 (2007 -  1,192,896.05 (adjusted to exclude
gains made by H C Dawe in 2006/07)).
7. Details of the performance conditions are shown on pages 35 and 36 and below. The award which was granted on 30.11.04 vested at 53.1% of the full entitlement.
8. The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 July 2008 was 477.5p and the range during the year was 377.75p to 1,320.0p.
Vesting of all but the last of these awards is conditional on the achievement of a TSR performance condition requiring Bellway's TSR to be at least at the median
of a comparator group of other housebuilders (at which point 33% of the award vests). Full vesting requires Bellway's TSR to be at the upper quartile. The
Comparator group comprises Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and T aylor Wimpey
plc (plus Countryside Properties PLC, Crest Nicholson plc, McCarthy & Stone plc, T aylor Woodrow plc, Westbury plc and Wilson Bowden plc, all of whom
have now delisted). The vesting conditions of the award granted on 16 January 2008 are set out on page 35.
There has been no change in the above potential future beneficial interests between 31 July 2008 and the date of this Report.
The executive directors had no further potential future beneficial interest in ordinary shares at 31 July 2008 and at the date of this report (1 August 2007 - Nil)
which are held by the Bellway Employee Share T rust (1992). For this T rust, a linking agreement is in place between the Group and the T rustees of the T rust,
Capita IRG T rustees Limited. This agreement ensures that sufficient shares/cash are available in the T rust to meet obligations as they arise. The directors had a
joint non-beneficial interest in 18,000 ordinary shares at 31 July 2008 and as at the date of this report (1 August 2007 - 18,000) which are held by the Bellway
p.l.c. 1988 Employee Benefit T rust.

Notes:
1. T axable benefits relate to the provision of motor vehicles, car allowance and private medical insurance.
2. The annual bonus is payable in November 2008 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2008. The Board Committee on Executive Directors' Remuneration
(the Committee ) has considered carefully the basis for bonus payments to executive directors for the 2007/08 year. The rapidly deteriorating housing market necessitated a review
of the budget process for the Company and associated bonus targets (set by reference to budget). Due to the genuinely exceptional circumstances, the Committee agreed that the
financial performance should be assessed at the end of the year, and the basis for the bonus should be determined at that time. Accordingly, at the Committee meeting in June, it was
confirmed that the bonus level should be equivalent to 55% of an executive director's salary. In coming to this conclusion, the Committee took into account the Company's financial
performance in its own right and also compared to other housebuilders, and considered that management's own performance had been very good in extremely challenging conditions.
3. The three executive directors ceased to accrue pension benefits under the terms of the Bellway plc 1972 Pension & Life Assurance Scheme with effect from 31 May 2008. As a
consequence the Committee agreed that the executive directors may receive a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions amounting to 30% of base salary commencing with effect
from 1 June 2008. The value of the cash payment has been calculated on a basis which is considered to be cost beneficial to the Company compared to the cost of continued accrual
under the terms of the executive directors' previous final salary arrangements.

Notes:
1. The pension shown as at, and transferred out on, 31 July 2008 is based on service to 31 May 2008, but excludes any statutory increases, which will reflect future
inflation after the year end (see  Pensions' section on page 37 for further details).
2. The  net of inflation increase' in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase in respect of inflation. The inflation rate used is that published for
September 2007 i.e. 3.9%.
3. There are no contributions from the directors to the Bellway plc 1972 Pension & Life Assurance Scheme; therefore there are no contributions to offset against the
transfer values shown.
4. The transfer value as at 31 July 2007 has been calculated employing the transfer value basis adopted for the scheme as at that date.

24 October 2008 Statement of Directors' Responsibilities in respect of the
Annual Report and the Accounts
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required to
prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs ) as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have
elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
The group and parent company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the group and
the parent company and the performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
 make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company will continue
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent
company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate
Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the
UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial
position and profit of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole and
 the Report of the Directors, the Chairman's Statement, the Chief Executive's Operating Review, the Corporate Responsibility Policy, the Summary
Corporate Responsibility Statement, the Environmental Policy Statement, the Financial Review and the Operating Risk Statement includes a fair review of the
development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole,
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
