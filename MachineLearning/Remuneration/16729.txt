 Annual Report and Accounts 2003 39
Remuneration report 
1. Introduction 
This report sets out the policy and disclosures on directors'
remuneration as required by the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 ( the Regulations') contained in
schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985. In accordance
with the Regulations, a resolution to approve this report will
be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting 
of the company at which the financial statements will be
approved. The vote will have advisory status in respect of the
remuneration policy and overall remuneration packages and
will not be specific to individual levels of remuneration. 
2. The Remuneration committee
The Remuneration committee is responsible for recommending
to the board the remuneration policy for executive directors,
together with the specific terms and conditions of employment
of each individual director, and for reviewing the overall policy
for executive remuneration.
Committee composition
The Remuneration committee consists of four non-executive
directors. The members of the committee are:
MG Adamson (chairman)
Lord MacGregor
MR Alexander
JF Harris
Harry Bailey was chairman and Professor Sir Roland Smith was
a member of the Remuneration committee until their retirements
in December 2002 and September 2003 respectively.
Consultants
The committee has appointed Towers Perrin to provide
independent market information and remuneration advice 
on an ongoing basis. Towers Perrin does not provide any
other consulting services to the company.
In addition to Towers Perrin, the following people provided
material advice or services to the committee during 
the year: 
Peter Jackson - Chief Executive 
Clive Francis - Group HR Director
3. Directors' remuneration policy 
The remuneration policy aims to:
  Provide alignment with the company's business objectives
  Attract and retain high calibre directors
  Motivate directors to achieve challenging performance levels
  Recognise both individual and corporate achievement
  Align executive rewards with shareholder value.
The total remuneration of executive directors comprises base
salary, annual and long-term incentives, pension and other
benefits. It is the company's policy to provide a significant
portion of the total potential rewards through performance
based schemes. The proportion of variable pay to fixed pay
has been increased over the past three years, and it is hoped
will be further increased over the next few years with the
introduction of a performance share plan for executive directors.
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed in light of mid-market data for
comparable companies in terms of size, market sector and
complexity. Other considerations in determining annual base
salaries are individual experience, performance and scope 
of responsibility.
Base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis, 
or following a significant change in responsibilities. 
Annual performance bonus 
Each executive director is eligible to participate in an annual cash
based bonus scheme with payments based on the achievement
of both stretching financial targets, and personal performance
against individual short and medium term objectives. Targets are
set by the committee before the beginning of the financial year. 
In 2003-4, the directors' target annual bonus will be around
40% of base salary with a maximum of 65% of salary.
The bonus plan is not pensionable except in the case of
Peter Jackson for whom there is a contractual obligation.  40 Associated British Foods plc
Remuneration report continued
Long-term incentives
Until 2003, the only long-term incentive received by executive directors was share options (as described below). Proposals
have now been made for the introduction of a new performance share plan for executive directors and other key executives.
Agreement is being sought from shareholders at the 2003 annual general meeting and details of the proposals will be found
on pages 82 and 83 in a note to the resolutions proposed at the annual general meeting.
Share options
There are two Associated British Foods Share Option Schemes under which Inland Revenue approved and unapproved options
may be granted. Under their service contracts, Peter Jackson and John Bason were both entitled to receive an annual allocation
of share options for each of five years and three years respectively, commencing December 1999. The committee has agreed
that although share options may continue to be granted on a selective basis, share option awards will now not form part of the
normal ongoing remuneration package for executives.
Other benefits
In line with comparable executive packages, executive directors are also entitled to the provision of a fully expensed company
car, private medical insurance, life assurance, home and mobile telephone costs and the reimbursement of reasonable business
expenses. The taxable value of these benefits is included in the table of directors' remuneration below.

5. Directors' pensions 
The aim of the Remuneration committee is that retirement benefits should be in line with good practice of major companies
in Continental Europe and the United Kingdom. 
In accordance with this policy, executive directors are covered by final salary defined benefit arrangements and can retire at
their normal retirement age with retirement benefits broadly equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary. The company
pension schemes are Inland Revenue approved. For Peter Jackson final pensionable salary includes basic salary and company
bonus. This contractual arrangement was put in place in 1999. 
Directors' pension disclosure for year ended 13 September 2003
The table below shows the defined benefit pension entitlements from the company pension schemes, and unfunded
unapproved arrangements where appropriate, of executive directors of Associated British Foods plc during the year ending
13 September 2003.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values increased as follows during the year:

(1) Pension accruals (A) and (C) are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end
of the year or earlier exit. 
George Weston remains in the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme but his active membership of the scheme has
been suspended since the start of his employment in George Weston Foods on 31 March 2003. He remains covered for
life assurance purposes. He also maintains his directorship. 
Harry Bailey was in receipt of pension throughout the year: his directorship ceased with effect from 5 December 2002.
There was no increase to his accrued pension over the period since his pension benefits were entirely accrued before the
start of the period.
(2) The pension values (E), (F) and (G) are transfer values calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11
issued by the actuarial profession. 42 Associated British Foods plc
Remuneration report continued
(3) The value of net increase in pension (E) represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the
year, resulting from additional service and increases in salary, and in the case of Peter Jackson, the recognition of year two
of a three year annual bonus plan. It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) after deducting the
director's contribution during the year (D).
(4) The change in the transfer value (H) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the
control of the company and directors, such as stock market movements. The director's contributions during the year (D)
are excluded from this value.
(5) John Bason accrues pension in the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme up to the earnings cap. In order to provide
a pension on his earnings above this level, the company has established an unfunded unapproved retirement benefits
scheme. George Weston was subject to a similar arrangement until 31 March 2003. 
(6) Additional voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
(7) Pension benefits include a 50% spouse's pension (except in the case of Peter Jackson where there is a two thirds spouse's
pension) payable on death before or after retirement, and pensions are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with
RPI limited each year to 5%. Additional discretionary increases to pensions in payment have been granted in the past. 
6. Directors' share options
At 13 September 2003 the market value of the company's ordinary shares over which employee options are issued was 535p.
During the previous twelve months the price ranged from 468p to 612p. 
As at 13 September 2003, the following directors had outstanding options to acquire ordinary shares of Associated British
Foods plc. During the period no options were exercised.

*Granted under the Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme.
Under their service contracts, Peter Jackson and John Bason were both entitled to receive an annual allocation of share
options for each of five years and three years respectively, commencing December 1999. With the exception of the grant in
2000-1, these allocations have been fulfilled under the rules of the Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme Annual Report and Accounts 2003 43
which was in existence when the contractual arrangements were put in place. The rules of the 1994 scheme require options
to be held for five years before they become exercisable, but options granted are not subject to any performance conditions.
Following shareholder approval of the Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme in December 2000,
share option grants made under this new share option scheme are subject to performance criteria based on the achievement
of specific levels of business performance over a three year period. Three year stretching financial targets, based on increased
profit and return on total investment, were set for all businesses in September 2000 and the 2000-1 executive directors'
contractual share option allocations were fulfilled using this new 2000 Share Option Scheme. The company performance
targets set for Peter Jackson and John Bason in respect of the options granted in January 2001 have now been met, and all
these options will be exercisable from 17 January 2004.
Subsequent grants of options to Peter Jackson and John Bason have been made under the 1994 Share Option Scheme as
no new three year targets have been set. 
George Weston was also granted options under the Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme in January
2001. The business performance targets set in September 2000 for Allied Bakeries have not been met and consequently only
50% of these options will be exercisable from 17 January 2004.

8. Directors' service contracts 
It is the committee's policy that all executive directors have rolling service contracts with twelve month notice periods.
The Articles of Association of Associated British Foods plc require that all directors retire from office at every third annual
general meeting. The details of the directors' contracts of service are set out below:

The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of appointment with WG Galen Weston in view of his
relationship with the ultimate holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited. He receives
no fees for performing his role as a non-executive director and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any
expenses incurred by him in that role.
The committee believes that twelve months' notice periods for executive directors are in line with market practice. 
The Remuneration committee's policy is that all cases of termination should be dealt with fairly whilst taking a robust line in
minimising any compensation. The executive directors' contracts do not include specific provisions concerning termination
payments as the committee believes that it is more able to respond appropriately to particular circumstances. The Remuneration
committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the revised Combined Code regarding inclusion of
explicit provisions in directors' service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination. The committee
will continue to keep its current practice under review.  Annual Report and Accounts 2003 45

10. Non-executive directors
The board reviews non-executive directors' fees periodically in the light of fees payable in comparable companies and the
importance attached to the retention and attraction of high calibre individuals as non-executive directors. Fees are paid on 
a per annum basis and are not varied for number of days worked. The chairman of the Audit committee is paid an additional
fee. Non-executive directors do not participate in the company's annual or long-term incentive plans, and take no part in any
discussion or decision concerning their own fees. 
No adjustments were made to the existing fees during the past financial year 2002-3. 
This report has been approved by the board and has been signed on its behalf by the Company Secretary.
