 Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 10 May 2006 inviting them to consider and approve this report.
The auditors are required to report to the Company's members on that part of this remuneration report which is subject to audit and to state whether, in their
opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
This report is therefore presented in two sections: unaudited information and audited information.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up solely of non-executive directors with no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters to 
be decided. Those non-executive directors serving on the Remuneration Committee, throughout the financial year, were Mr Tim Melville-Ross, 
Mr Mark Nicholls and Mrs Lesley MacDonagh. On 14 November 2005, Mr Tim Melville-Ross was appointed non-executive Chairman following the resignation
of Sir Nigel Mobbs from that role. As a result, for a small part of 2005 the Group was not compliant with the requirements of the Combined Code in respect
of the Remuneration Committee having only independent directors as members. Following the appointment of Mr John Warren as an independent 
non-executive director on 1 March 2006, he was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee with effect from close of business on 10 March 2006.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross resigned his membership of that committee with effect from the same date. Meetings of the Remuneration Committee are held as and
when appropriate and at least annually. During 2005, the Remuneration Committee met on six occasions and each meeting was attended by all the members,
other than the meeting on 14 November 2005 when Mr Tim Melville-Ross was absent, the purpose of the meeting being to set his remuneration as non-
executive Chairman. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, from time to time, calls upon Mr Malcolm Harris (Chief Executive) to assist in discussions and deliberations of the Remuneration
Committee on remuneration matters not pertaining to the remuneration or terms and conditions of his own employment. The Remuneration Committee has,
on occasion, appointed the services of external advisers to advise on director remuneration. During September 2005 The Hay Group was appointed as adviser
to the Remuneration Committee on an ongoing basis. Towers Perrin act as Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan. The Group Company
Secretary, Mr Martin Palmer, acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
Duties of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the following duties:
  Determine on behalf of the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive, the executive
directors and such other members of the executive management as it is designated to consider.  
  Ensure that executive directors and senior management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are rewarded
for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
  Determine targets for any performance related pay schemes and ask the Board, when appropriate, to seek shareholder approval for any long term 
incentive arrangements. 
  Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance criteria of all share based remuneration schemes.
  Ensure that contractual terms on termination and any payments made avoid rewarding poor performance and approve any severance payments. 
  Determine the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman, Chief Executive, each executive director and other designated senior executives,
including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options.
  Determine the policy for and scope of service agreements for executive directors and pensions arrangements, termination payments and compensation
commitments.
  Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance conditions of the annual bonus scheme and approve annual bonuses.
  In determining remuneration packages and arrangements, give due regard to the requirements and recommendations of the Combined Code as well as the
UK Listing Authority's Listing Rules and associated guidance.
  Review competitor companies but ensure that automatic increases are not implemented.
  Oversee any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company.
  Ensure that the provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration, including pensions, as set out in the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, are
fulfilled and produce an annual report of the Committee's remuneration policy to be included in the Company's Annual Report and Accounts.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Group's website www.bovishomesgroup.plc.uk and on request to the Group
Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company's policy for the remuneration of executive directors, having regard to the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 (Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985) and the Combined Code and its provisions on directors' remuneration (Schedules A and B).
Report on directors' remuneration
Page 28 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomesgroup.plc.uk The Remuneration Committee sets and implements the remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and designated senior management. 
The Remuneration Committee determines the need for independent professional advice where appropriate and has regard to information on compensation
and salary levels in companies in the housebuilding sector and in other companies of comparable size, for executives with similar skills, qualifications 
and experience. The objectives of the remuneration policy are to:
  ensure that the individual rewards and incentives fairly relate to the performance of the individual, the Company and the interests of shareholders;
  maintain a remuneration package which enables the Company to attract, retain, and motivate executives of the appropriate calibre and experience to
further the success of the Company and maximise long term shareholder value; and
  take into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
The remuneration policy was reviewed by the Remuneration Committee during 2005.
Remuneration package
The remuneration package of the executive directors consists of basic salary, performance bonus, health insurance, membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated
Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS), pension, death in service insurance, and participation in the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
In prior years, participation in the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme and Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan has also formed part
of the executive directors' remuneration package. The Group suspended use of the Executive Share Option Scheme during 2004 after shareholder approval
was provided to increase the maximum awards which can be granted under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan from 75% to 100% of basic
annual salary. During 2004, the Group also suspended use of the share incentive plan in respect of the awarding of free shares in the Company.
The Remuneration Committee aims to balance appropriately those elements of an executive director's remuneration which are subject to explicit performance
conditions, accepting that all remuneration is linked with ongoing appraisal of individual performance. By virtue of the various elements of directors'
remuneration subject to performance conditions, a significant part is variable and is not guaranteed. For remuneration paid during 2005 the fixed and variable
elements of the remuneration package of each director were as follows:
Salary
Executive director salaries are reviewed annually on 1 July taking into account the total remuneration package at the time of the review.
External directorships
Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and organisations outside 
the Group. Earnings arising from such external directorships are payable directly to the Company.
Performance bonus
Executive directors are able to earn a performance bonus up to a maximum of 100% of basic annual salary prevailing at the date of the Remuneration
Committee meeting to determine bonuses. It is considered that such maximum performance bonus levels create an appropriate level of short term incentive,
and align suitably with the performance bonus entitlements of other companies in the housebuilding sector as well as other publicly listed companies of a
similar size to the Company.
The bonuses payable to executive directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference to challenging performance criteria including
exceeding the previous year's profit before taxation by a specified percentage and the achievement of other strategic targets.
The bonuses of the executive directors are paid from a bonus pool which is generated from increases in profits over the previous year. All office based
employees share in this bonus pool. The rules governing the generation of the bonus pool remain consistent with prior years. Site employees are incentivised
through direct site bonus schemes based on measurable site performance.
The bonus pool remains at zero until profits before taxation and bonus charge increase over the prior year by 2% above the increase in the Retail Price Index
( RPI'). Thereafter, for every 1% increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge over the prior year, a value equal to 0.5% of the Group's profit before
taxation and bonus charge is allocated to the bonus pool. This applies until the increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge reaches 12% over the
increase in RPI at which point the total value allocated to the bonus pool is capped. At this maximum value the bonus pool will equal 5% of the Group's profit
before taxation and bonus charge. Bonus payments in aggregate are restricted to a maximum equal to the value allocated to the bonus pool.
The bonus pool is applied in settling individual employee bonuses subject to individual performance, corporate performance and set bonus caps. Any surplus
bonus pool remaining after settling employee bonuses reverts to the Group and is included in the profits for that financial year.

18% Executive directors have a bonus cap equal to 100% of basic salary. In addition to the requirement for the bonus pool to have sufficient value to pay employee
bonuses, the Remuneration Committee has established challenging performance criteria for executive directors to determine bonus levels. For bonuses equal
to 100% of basic salary to be considered for payment, specific financial criteria have to be met, including:
  achievement of an increase in Group profits before taxation and bonus of 12% over and above the increase in RPI; and
  achievement of return on average capital employed in excess of 20% for the year; and
  achievement of the Group's budgeted profit before taxation for the year.
Performance bonus payments
The bonuses paid to executive directors in 2005 in respect of the 2004 financial year were approved by the Remuneration Committee after considering the
achievement or otherwise of the performance criteria set for the financial year 2004. The actual performance compared to these specific financial performance
criteria can be summarised:
Criteria Performance criteria Actual performance
Growth in Group profits before taxation and bonus +15.4% (12%+RPI) +18.0%
Return on average capital employed 20.0% 26.4%
The Group exceeded its budgeted pre tax profit for 2004.
Following the consideration of performance criteria set, the Remuneration Committee has resolved to award no bonuses in respect of the 2005 financial year.
Pension
All the executive directors are senior executive members of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme. This is a contributory funded, defined benefit scheme approved
by the Inland Revenue. Pensionable earnings are basic pay. As a result of joining the Company after the implementation of the 1989 earnings cap rules, Mr
David Ritchie is subject to the statutory earnings cap. Mr Malcolm Harris is not subject to the earnings cap. Normal retirement age for senior executive
members under the scheme is 60, and the accrual rate is 1/45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service as a senior executive.
Share schemes
The Company employs a standard set of performance conditions for all executive directors in respect of the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option
Scheme and the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan. These performance conditions are described under specific headings in this report. Granting of
share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The performance conditions are designed
to challenge and motivate executive directors to improve profitability and enhance shareholder return. The conditions are designed to require strong collective
and individual performance from the executive directors before options and awards vest, whilst at the same time offering a credible opportunity for success.
For share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to vest an independent view provided by the Company's auditors, as independent experts,
is required certifying achievement of the relevant performance conditions. This independent view is evidenced by the completion of formal certificates signed
by the auditors. The performance conditions attaching to share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are selected intentionally to be derived
from readily available information which is straightforward and transparent. This ensures that the auditors can make objective assessments of achievement
against the performance conditions.
Although there exist outstanding share options granted to executive directors and senior management which remain unexercised at the date of this report,
the Remuneration Committee resolved, effective of 5 May 2004, to suspend the grant of future awards of share options. The rules of the Bovis Homes Group
PLC Executive Share Option Scheme relating to vesting and exercising outstanding share options remain unaltered.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997. The Remuneration Committee suspended the issuing of new share options
on 5 May 2004. It is an Inland Revenue approved scheme and has historically granted share options on an approved basis within Inland Revenue limits and
on an unapproved basis outside Inland Revenue limits. The scheme is operated by the Remuneration Committee with participants selected at the sole discretion
of the Remuneration Committee.
For outstanding share options, the performance criteria require that any share option held under the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme
can only normally be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in
RPI by at least 4% per annum (2% per annum for share options granted before 2001) over three consecutive years.
The exercise price of a share option has been determined by the Board at the date of grant and has not been less than the higher of the market value and
nominal value of an ordinary share in the Company at the date of grant.
Assuming the performance criteria are satisfied, share options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from
the date of grant.
Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan
A Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2000 Annual General Meeting and established
on 10 May 2000. An amendment to the rules of the Long Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting on 5 May
2004. Under the amended rules of the scheme at the date of this report a participant may receive in respect of any year a maximum award of shares with a
market value, when the award was made, not exceeding 100% of basic salary. Each award is made subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria
and awards may only be exercised at the end of three years. There is no cost to the participants in the scheme to exercise the awards.
The extent to which the awards may be exercised is determined by two measures of performance; total shareholder return ( TSR') and earnings per share ( EPS')
growth, each measured over a three year performance period and each relating to half of the shares awarded.
Report on directors' remuneration continued
Page 30 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomesgroup.plc.uk The TSR measure requires the comparison of the growth in the Company's TSR over a three year period to that of a group of comparator companies in the
housebuilding industry specified by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the performance period. TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and
dividends paid during the three year period (assuming that such dividends are reinvested in ordinary shares). The Company's ranking amongst the comparator
companies will determine the percentage of the shares under the award which will vest, as follows:
TSR ranking % of total award which can be realised
1st position 50% of the shares in the award
2nd position 45% of the shares in the award
3rd position 37.5% of the shares in the award
4th position 30% of the shares in the award
5th position 20% of the shares in the award
6th position 15% of the shares in the award
The group of comparator companies is as follows:
Comparator companies
Barratt Developments PLC Bellway p.l.c. The Berkeley Group plc Crest Nicholson PLC
McCarthy and Stone PLC Persimmon plc Redrow Group plc Taylor Woodrow plc
Wilson Bowden plc George Wimpey PLC
The EPS growth measure is based on the extent to which the Company's average annual EPS growth over the three year performance period falls between
minimum and maximum EPS growth targets set by the Remuneration Committee as follows:
EPS growth % of total award which can be realised
Maximum EPS growth 50% of the shares in the award
Minimum EPS growth 20% of the shares in the award
For the current outstanding awards, the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets are 4% and 10% above RPI respectively. Where EPS growth falls between
the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets, the number of shares which can be realised will be determined on a straight line sliding scale. Where EPS
growth falls below 4% above RPI, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS growth can be realised.
The shares required to satisfy the awards have been purchased by the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust. The grant price of the awards is set as the market
value of the shares at the date the shares are purchased by the Trustee. The market value of the shares attributable to each director will be included in
remuneration in the year in which the awards are exercised. An award may only be exercised within six months of the realisation date, the realisation date
being the date of notification from the Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust that the award is realisable in whole or in part.
Performance graph
As required by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the following table includes a performance graph comparing, over the last five financial
years, the Total Shareholder Return of an ordinary share held in Bovis Homes Group PLC against the Total Shareholder Return of the FTSE All Share Construction
and Building Materials index. This comparable index is appropriate given that the Remuneration Committee has considered an appropriate comparator group
of companies for benchmarking performance. This comparator group is currently made up of ten UK listed housebuilders, all of which are included in the FTSE
All Share Construction and Building Materials index. The ordinary shares of Bovis Homes Group PLC are included within the FTSE All Share Construction and
Building Materials Index. As such, the FTSE All Share Construction and Building Materials Index is considered by the Remuneration Committee to be a
representative comparator for Total Shareholder Return performance.

Changes in the number of ordinary shares held arose from the exercise of share options, the vesting and exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards and the
investment during the year in partnership shares through the Inland Revenue approved Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan. Other changes in the number
of shares held arose through the electing for shares in place of dividends as part of the Company's scrip dividend offer and share purchases by Mrs Lesley
MacDonagh. There were no changes in the holdings of ordinary shares of any of the directors between 31 December 2005 and 10 March 2006, other than the
normal monthly investment in partnership shares through the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan. Mr John Warren is beneficially interested in 
2,500 shares.
The directors' interests in share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on pages 34 to 35. There were no changes in the holdings
of share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan between 31 December 2005 and 10 March 2006.
Share ownership guidelines
There exist guidelines for executive directors in respect of share ownership of Bovis Homes' shares. The Board expects executive directors benefiting from the
exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of share options to retain at least 50% of the net value derived from the exercise, after settling all
costs and income tax due, as shares. This guideline is expected to be applied until such time as the executive director holds shares with a market value equal
to current basic annual salary.

Mr Malcolm Harris' increase was assessed against equivalent salaries of Chief Executives working for other housebuilders and publicly listed companies of a
similar size. 
The increase in respect of Mr David Ritchie's basic salary reflected the view of the Remuneration Committee of Mr Ritchie's growing experience and period 
of service in the role of Finance Director as well as information provided of equivalent salaries of Finance Directors working for other publicly listed 
UK housebuilders.
In addition to his basic salary, Mr David Ritchie received payments equivalent to the employer's pension contributions above the statutory earnings cap. 
During 2005,  30,446 was paid in this respect.
There were no increases in the fees payable to non-executive directors on 1 July 2005. On 14 November 2005, the non-executive fees payable to Mr Tim
Melville-Ross were increased from  30,000 to  80,000 following his appointment as  non-executive Chairman, and the non-executive fees payable to Mr Mark
Nicholls were increased from  30,000 to  33,000 following his appointment as the Senior Independent Director.
Directors' emoluments are in the form of cash with the exception of the provision of health insurance and death in service insurance provided in excess of
the earnings cap, where applicable.
The gains for directors on the exercise of share options and Long Term Incentive Plan awards are shown on page 35.
