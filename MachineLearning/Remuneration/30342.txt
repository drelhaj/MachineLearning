 Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2008 inviting them to consider and approve this report.
The auditors are required to report to the Company's members on that part of this remuneration report which is subject to audit and to state whether, in their
opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
This report is therefore presented in two sections: unaudited information and audited information.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up solely of non-executive directors with no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters to 
be decided. Those non-executive directors serving on the Remuneration Committee throughout 2007 were Mr John Warren, who also chaired the Committee
until 11 May 2007, Mr Colin Holmes who has chaired the Committee since that date and Mrs Lesley MacDonagh. Mr Mark Nicholls served until his retirement
from the Board on 11 May 2007. Meetings of the Remuneration Committee are held as and when appropriate and at least annually. During 2007, the
Remuneration Committee met on seven occasions and all members, then current, attended each meeting with the exception of Mrs Lesley MacDonagh who
missed one meeting by prior arrangement. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, from time to time, calls upon Mr Malcolm Harris (Chief Executive) to assist in discussions and deliberations of the Remuneration
Committee on remuneration matters not pertaining to the remuneration or terms and conditions of his own employment. The Remuneration Committee has,
on occasion, appointed the services of external advisers to advise on director remuneration. The Hay Group has been appointed as adviser to the Remuneration
Committee on an ongoing basis, has no other connection with the Company and provides reports and advice as required. ExcellerateHRO Share Plan Services
(formely Towers Perrin) act as Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan. The Group Company Secretary, Mr Martin Palmer, acts as Secretary
to the Remuneration Committee.

Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company's policy for the remuneration of executive directors, having regard to the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 (Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985) and the Combined Code and its provisions on directors' remuneration, including 
Schedule A.
Report on directors' remuneration
38 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomes.co.uk/plc The Remuneration Committee sets and implements remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and designated senior management. 
The Remuneration Committee determines the need for independent professional advice where appropriate and has regard to information on compensation
and salary levels in companies in the housebuilding sector and in other companies of comparable size, for executives with similar skills, qualifications 
and experience. The objectives of the remuneration policy are to:
  ensure that the individual rewards and incentives fairly relate to the performance of the individual, the Company and the interests of shareholders;
  maintain a remuneration package which enables the Company to attract, retain, and motivate executives of the appropriate calibre and experience to
further the success of the Company and maximise long term shareholder value; and
  take into account pay and employment conditions throughout the Group.
The remuneration policy was reviewed by the Remuneration Committee during 2007.
Remuneration package
The remuneration package of the executive directors consists of basic salary, performance bonus, health insurance, membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated
Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS), pension, death in service assurance, and participation in the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
In prior years, participation in the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme and Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan has also formed part
of the executive directors' remuneration package. The Group suspended use of the Executive Share Option Scheme during 2004 and this scheme expired in
2007, although options previously granted to executive directors are still current. During 2004, the Group also suspended use of the share incentive plan in
respect of the awarding of free shares in the Company.
The Remuneration Committee aims to balance appropriately those elements of an executive director's remuneration which are subject to explicit performance
conditions, accepting that all remuneration is linked with ongoing appraisal of individual performance. By virtue of the various elements of directors'
remuneration subject to performance conditions, a significant part is variable and is not guaranteed. The potential remuneration package, dependent on
performance, reflects one-third fixed and two-thirds variable elements. Whilst the Remuneration Committee aims to achieve this balance, it recognises that
the payout in any year will vary from this. The chart below to the left shows this graphically.
For remuneration earned during 2007 the fixed element, being salary, and variable elements, which include bonus in respect of 2007 and gains on the exercise
of LTIP awards granted in 2004, are shown, by director, in the three charts immediately above and to the right. No bonus awards were made to the executive
directors in respect of the financial year 2007. As Mr Neil Cooper commenced with the Company on 2 January 2007 he had no entitlement to exercise awards
under the LTIP during 2007. Mr Cooper's remuneration therefore comprised solely salary.
Salary
Executive director salaries are reviewed annually on 1 July taking into account the total remuneration package at the time of the review.
External directorships
Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and organisations outside 
the Group. Earnings arising from such external directorships are payable directly to the Company.
Performance bonus
Executive directors are able to earn a performance bonus up to a maximum of 100% of basic annual salary prevailing at the date of the Remuneration
Committee meeting to determine bonuses. It is considered that such maximum performance bonus levels create an appropriate level of short term incentive,
and align suitably with the performance bonus entitlements of other companies in the housebuilding sector as well as other publicly listed companies of a
similar size to the Company.
The bonuses payable to executive directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference to challenging performance criteria including
exceeding the previous year's profit before taxation by a specified percentage and the achievement of other strategic targets.
The bonuses of the executive directors are paid from a bonus pool which is generated from increases in profits over the previous year. All office based
employees share in this bonus pool. The rules governing the generation of the bonus pool remain consistent with prior years. Site employees are incentivised
through direct site bonus schemes based on measurable site performance.
The bonus pool remains at zero until profits before taxation and bonus charge increase over the prior year by 2% above the increase in the Retail Price Index
( RPI'). Thereafter, for every 1% increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge over the prior year, a value equal to 0.5% of the Group's profit before
taxation and bonus charge is allocated to the bonus pool. This applies until the increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge reaches 12% over the
increase in RPI at which point the total value allocated to the bonus pool is capped. At this maximum value the bonus pool will equal 5% of the Group's profit
before taxation and bonus charge. Bonus payments in aggregate are restricted to a maximum equal to the value allocated to the bonus pool.
The bonus pool is applied in settling individual employee bonuses subject to individual performance, corporate performance and set bonus caps. Any surplus
bonus pool remaining after settling employee bonuses reverts to the Group and is included in the profits for that financial year.

(variable) Executive directors have a bonus cap equal to 100% of basic salary. In addition to the requirement for the bonus pool to have sufficient value to pay employee
bonuses, the Remuneration Committee has established challenging performance criteria for executive directors to determine bonus levels. For bonuses equal
to 100% of basic salary to be considered for payment, specific financial criteria have to be met, including:
  achievement of an increase in Group profits before taxation and bonus of 10%; and
  achievement of return on capital employed in excess of 20% for the year; and
  achievement of the Group's budgeted profit before taxation for the year.
Performance bonus payments
The bonuses paid to executive directors in 2007 in respect of the 2006 financial year were approved by the Remuneration Committee after considering the
achievement or otherwise of the performance criteria set for the financial year 2006. The actual performance compared to these specific financial performance
criteria can be summarised:
Criteria Performance criteria Actual performance
Growth in Group profits before taxation and bonus 16.0% (12%+RPI) 17.9%
Return on capital employed 20% 20%
The Group exceeded its budgeted pre tax profit for 2006. Following the consideration of performance criteria set for the financial year 2007 the Remuneration
Committee has resolved not to award bonuses to the executive directors serving during 2007.
Pension
Two of the executive directors who served during 2007 were senior executive members of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme. This is a contributory funded,
defined benefit scheme approved by HMRC. Pensionable earnings were equal to basic pay prior to 6 April 2006. From 6 April 2006, increases in pensionable
earnings are restricted each year to the lesser of the percentage increase in basic pay and 2.5%. Mr Malcolm Harris is not subject to the earnings cap and 
Mr David Ritchie is subject to the statutory earnings cap for service until 5 April 2006. Following the introduction of the lifetime allowance pension rules on
6 April 2006, Mr David Ritchie is not subject to an earnings cap for service from 6 April 2006. Normal retirement age for senior executive members under the
scheme is 60, and the accrual rate is 1/45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service as a senior executive.
The third executive director serving during 2007 was a member of the Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan, a contracted-in defined contribution
arrangement, to which the Company contributes 7% of basic annual salary per annum. Normal retirement age for joiners after 1 October 2006 is age 65.
Share schemes
The Company employs a standard set of performance conditions for all executive directors in respect of outstanding options under the Bovis Homes Group
PLC Executive Share Option Scheme and awards under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan. These performance conditions are described under
specific headings in this report. The granting of awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
The performance conditions are designed to challenge and motivate executive directors to improve profitability and enhance shareholder return. The conditions
are also designed to require strong collective and individual performance from the executive directors before options and awards vest, whilst at the same time
offering a credible opportunity for success.
For share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to vest an independent report is provided by the Company's auditors, as independent experts,
to the Company confirming achievement of the relevant performance conditions. The performance conditions attaching to share options and awards under
the Long Term Incentive Plan are selected intentionally to be derived from readily available information which is straightforward and transparent. This ensures
that the auditors can make objective assessments of achievement against the performance conditions.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997. The Remuneration Committee suspended the issuing of new share options
on 5 May 2004. It is an HMRC approved scheme which expired in 2007 and historically granted share options on an approved basis within HMRC limits and
on an unapproved basis outside HMRC limits. The rules of the scheme relating to vesting and exercising outstanding share options remained unaltered at the
scheme's expiry.
For outstanding share options, the performance criteria require that any share option held under the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme
can only normally be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in
RPI by at least 4% per annum (2% per annum for share options granted before 2001) over three consecutive years.
The exercise price of a share option has been determined by the Board at the date of grant and has not been less than the higher of the market value and
nominal value of an ordinary share in the Company at the date of grant.
Assuming the performance criteria are satisfied, share options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from
the date of grant.
Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan
A Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2000 Annual General Meeting and established
on 10 May 2000. An amendment to the rules of the Long Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and under
the amended rules of the plan at the date of this report a participant may receive in respect of any financial year a maximum award of shares with a market
value, when the award is made, not exceeding 100% of basic salary. Each award is made subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria and awards
may only be exercised at the end of three years. There is no cost to the participants in the plan to exercise the awards.
Report on directors' remuneration continued
40 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomes.co.uk/plc The extent to which the awards may be exercised is determined by two measures of performance; total shareholder return ( TSR') and earnings per share ( EPS')
growth, each measured over a three year performance period and each relating to half of the shares awarded.
The TSR measure requires the comparison of the growth in the Company's TSR over a three year period to that of a group of comparator companies in the
housebuilding industry specified by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the performance period. TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and
dividends paid during the three year period (assuming that such dividends are reinvested in ordinary shares). For awards granted in 2005 and 2006 the
Company's ranking amongst the comparator companies will be used to determine the percentage of the shares under the award which will vest, as follows:
TSR ranking % of total award which can be realised
1st position 50% of the shares in the award
2nd position 45% of the shares in the award
3rd position 37.5% of the shares in the award
4th position 30% of the shares in the award
5th position 20% of the shares in the award
6th position 15% of the shares in the award
Recognising the reduction in comparator companies and the lack of suitable replacements, the Remuneration Committee has determined that the performance
of companies acquired during the three year performance periods applicable to the 2005 and 2006 awards will from the date of acquisition be notionally
reinvested in the company which has the median TSR performance from the date of acquisition to the end of the performance period (excluding other acquired
companies), maintaining the number of comparator companies and the vesting schedule based on ranking for these awards.
The group of comparator companies to be used for the 2005 and 2006 awards is as follows:
Comparator companies
Barratt Developments PLC Bellway p.l.c. The Berkeley Group plc Crest Nicholson PLC
Persimmon plc Redrow Group plc Taylor Woodrow plc Westbury plc
Wilson Bowden plc George Wimpey PLC
During 2007 the Remuneration Committee carried out a review of the TSR measure and for awards granted from 2007 onwards it has been revised from one
based on ranking to one operating on the basis of performance relative to the median over the three year performance period, as derived from the TSR
performance of the comparator companies.  Measuring performance against the median has been adopted in the context of a reducing comparator group, to
ensure a robust approach and one less prone to distortions and as being considered viable for smaller comparator groups. Vesting has been revised as follows:
TSR performance % of total award which can be realised
Maximum TSR performance 50% of the shares in the award
Threshold TSR performance 15% of the shares in the award
Threshold TSR performance has been set at the median and maximum TSR performance has been set at median plus 15% per annum compound out-
performance against the group of comparator companies.  Where TSR performance falls between the threshold and the maximum TSR performance, the
percentage of shares which can be realised will be calculated on a straight line sliding scale. Where TSR falls below median, none of the shares in the award
judged by reference to TSR can be realised.
A consultation took place with major shareholders on this revised TSR performance measure during April 2007 with a positive response.
The group of comparator companies for the 2007 awards onwards is comprised as follows:
Comparator companies
Barratt Developments PLC Bellway p.l.c. The Berkeley Group plc Persimmon plc
Redrow Group plc Taylor Wimpey plc
The EPS growth measure is unaltered and is based on the extent to which the Company's average annual EPS growth over the three year performance period
falls between minimum and maximum EPS growth targets set by the Remuneration Committee as follows:
EPS growth % of total award which can be realised
Maximum EPS growth 50% of the shares in the award
Threshold EPS growth 20% of the shares in the award
For the current outstanding awards, the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets are 4% and 10% per annum above RPI respectively. Where EPS growth
falls between the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets, the number of shares which can be realised will be determined on a straight line sliding scale.
Where EPS growth falls below 4% above RPI, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS growth can be realised.
The shares required to satisfy the awards have been purchased by the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust. The grant price of the awards is set as the market
value of the shares at the date of grant. The market value of the shares attributable to each director will be included in remuneration in the year in which the
awards are exercised. An award may only be exercised within six months of the realisation date, the realisation date being the date of notification from the
Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust that the award is realisable in whole or in part.

Changes in the number of ordinary shares held arose from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards, and investment during the year in partnership
shares through the HMRC approved Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan. Other changes in the number of shares held arose through electing for shares
in place of dividends as part of the Company's scrip dividend offer and share purchases by Mr Neil Cooper and Mr Colin Holmes. There were no changes in
the holdings of ordinary shares of any of the directors between 31 December 2007 and 7 March 2008, other than the normal monthly investment in
partnership shares through the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan.
The directors' interests in share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on pages 45 to 46. There were no changes in the holdings
of share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan between 31 December 2007 and 7 March 2008.
Share ownership guidelines
There exist guidelines for executive directors in respect of share ownership of Bovis Homes' shares. The Board expects executive directors benefiting from the
exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of share options to retain at least 50% of the net value derived from the exercise, after settling all
costs and income tax due, as shares. This guideline is expected to be applied until such time as the executive director holds shares with a market value equal
to current basic annual salary.

Mr Malcolm Harris's increase was assessed against equivalent salaries of Chief Executives working for other housebuilders and publicly listed companies of a
similar size.
The increase in respect of Mr David Ritchie's basic salary was assessed against equivalent salaries of Group Managing Directors and similar roles in other
housebuilders and publicly listed companies of comparable size. On taking up the position of Group Managing Director on 2 January 2007, Mr David Ritchie's
salary was increased from  262,500 to  300,000 and this new salary was similarly assessed.
In addition to his basic salary, Mr David Ritchie during 2006 received payments equivalent to the employer's pension contributions above the statutory
earnings cap totalling  7,942. These payments ceased on 5 April 2006.
Mr Neil Cooper's salary increase reflected an assessment against equivalent salaries of Finance Directors working for other UK quoted housebuilders together
with his relative level of experience. During the year Mr Neil Cooper also recharged  35,000 of qualifying relocation expenses to the Company.
During 2006, the Company reviewed the level of fees paid to its non-executive directors, supported by an independent benchmarking exercise assessing the
fees payable to non-executive directors in similar companies, comparable both in terms of sector, and in terms of size.
Fees payable to Mr John Warren were increased from  40,000 to  45,000 with effect from 11 May 2007 following his appointment as the Senior Independent
Director and fees payable to Mr Colin Holmes were increased from  35,000 to  40,000 following his appointment as Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee on the same date.
Directors' emoluments are in the form of cash with the exception of the provision of health insurance and death in service assurance provided in excess of
the earnings cap until 5 April 2006, where applicable.
The gains for directors on the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards are shown on page 46.

Report on directors' remuneration continued
46 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomes.co.uk/plc The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements, in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent
Company financial statements on the same basis.
The Group and Parent Company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the Group
and the Parent Company and the performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in
the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
  for the Group and Parent Company financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent
Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a directors' report, report on directors' remuneration and report on
corporate governance that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in
the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
