Report of the Directors
Remuneration report
Introduction
This year's Remuneration report is prepared in accordance with Part 3 of schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 (the  Act') and will be subject  
to an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting ( AGM').
The key issues to be aware of this year are:
1.  As a result of the tough trading conditions, no annual bonuses have been earned and the Directors have not been awarded a salary increase. 
Similarly, as performance targets have not been met, the Long-Term Performance Plan ( LTPP') award granted in 2005 will not vest.
2.  The Remuneration Committee is proposing to suspend the operation of the LTPP and subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM 
grant market value share options to the Company's most senior executives under a new Executive Share Option Scheme.
3.  A Return On Capital Employed ( ROCE') performance condition shall apply to options granted this year. The Remuneration Committee feels that 
ROCE is the most rounded measure of financial performance for a housebuilder in the current trading environment. It is a fundamental measure  
of Barratt's underlying performance and is directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders.
4. The Committee also wishes to introduce a savings-related share option scheme to encourage wider employee share ownership.
Remuneration Committee 
The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on behalf of the Board for:

Membership and proceedings of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the financial year were Mr R J Davies (Chairman), Mr C G Toner, Mr M Pescod, Mr W Shannon 
and Mr R MacEachrane. Mr M Pescod retired from the Remuneration Committee on 31 December 2007 , Mr C G Toner resigned from the Remuneration 
Committee on 30 June 2008 and Mr R A Lawson joined the Remuneration Committee on 1 July 2008. Attendance at Remuneration Committee 
meetings is described on page 31 of the Report of the Directors. All Committee members are considered to be wholly independent with no financial 
interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committee's decisions. The Group Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee as required but he is 
not present when matters affecting his own remuneration are considered. 
The Remuneration Committee has complied with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. The Committee recognises its accountability  
on executive remuneration to shareholders through this report and through regular dialogue with institutional investors. In determining future 
remuneration policy it will consider both the shareholders' vote on the report and views expressed by shareholders on the detail of the report.
Advice
Advice is provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary, Mr L Dent, a solicitor and Mrs J Mee, the Group Human Resources 
Director. Mr Dent also acts as secretary to the Committee. In addition, independent advisors Hewitt New Bridge Street and Hay Group advised  
the Committee in relation to changes to the Company's remuneration policy and on the design, establishment and operation of remuneration 
arrangements. Hewitt New Bridge Street and Hay Group did not provide any additional services to the Company.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited has advised the Company in relation to various pension issues and, with effect from 10 July 2004, 
were appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
Remuneration policy 
Each year the Remuneration Committee reviews the policy on executive remuneration in the context of the business environment, best practice 
and market trends for the current and subsequent financial years. The underlying principles remain the same, namely the Committee believes that 
executive remuneration:

Report of the Directors | Remuneration report 
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting 
the remuneration of the Executive Directors. In addition, the Remuneration Committee does take into account environmental, social and governance 
risks when setting any incentive structures for senior management in order to mitigate the possibility of the incentive structures motivating 
irresponsible behaviour.
Central to the Group remuneration policy is recognition that the sustained growth and profitability of the business is determined in no short measure 
by the skill and commitment of the Executive Team. The reward policy for Executive Directors seeks to provide remuneration and other service 
conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and reward Executive Directors of the highest calibre within the industry's highly competitive employment 
market. Within these broad objectives the executive remuneration package is based on the following principles:
  	 	 t h e 	 g r e a t e r 	 p a r t 	 o f 	 r e m u n e r a t i o n 	 p a i d 	 t o 	 e x e c u t i v e s 	 s h o u l d 	 b e 	 l i n k e d 	 t o 	 t h e 	 a c h i e v e m e n t 	 o f 	 d e m a n d i n g 	 p e r f o r m a n c e 	 t a r g e t s ; 	 c u r r e n t l y 	 o v e r 	 5 0 %

measures of shareholder return. The current targets are based on Total Shareholder Return and Earnings Per Share but the Company intends  
to introduce a Return On Capital Employed target for 2008; and

The remuneration package for Executive Directors
The remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises:
 	 ba sic 	 s a la r y ;
 	 a nnu a l 	 p e r f or ma nc e 	 re lat e d 	 bonus ;
 	 long- t e r m 	 s ha re 	 inc e nt i v e s ; 	 a nd
  	 p e n s i o n 	 a n d 	 o t h e r 	 b e n efi t s .
The performance conditions which apply to the performance related element of executive remuneration are the same for all Executive Directors and 
are set out in the following sections of this report.
Basic salary
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash. Salaries are set having regard to individual responsibilities, 
skills and experience and to competitive market practice. As part of the review carried out, the Committee looked at the market rate for similar 
positions in large national housebuilding companies, and also for companies comprising the FTSE 250. This provides a broad perspective on pay, 
although the primary comparator group remains the housebuilding companies. It was decided that in light of the prevailing market conditions 
salaries for the Executive Directors would remain unchanged for the coming year. Therefore salaries with effect from 1 July 2008 remain as follows: 
    1 July 2008 1 July 2007 
      per annum   per annum
Mr M S Clare    630,000 630,000
Mr S J Boyes    350,000 350,000
Mr C Fenton    350,000 350,000
Mr M A Pain    350,000 350,000
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is dependent upon the achievement of demanding financial objectives and key strategic measures for the business, set annually 
by the Board. For the attainment of 100% of target the amount of bonus will be 130% of basic salary. The maximum amount of bonus which can be 
received by any executive is 180% of basic salary for the attainment of 110% of target. If actual performance falls below 90% of target then no bonus 
will be payable. Payment of the bonus is on a progressive scale with proportionately more being attainable for performance over and above target. 
Performance objectives for the 2008/9 year will be based on cash and profit targets.
Any bonus earned above target is deferred on a compulsory basis, with an opportunity for additional voluntary deferral. The deferred amounts will 
be converted into shares under the Co-Investment Plan, with an opportunity for additional matching shares to be received on a one for one basis  
if further performance targets are met. These additional performance targets are the same as those used for the Long-Term Performance Plan,  
as detailed on page 39. 39
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors | Remuneration report 
No part of the annual bonus is pensionable. 
For the financial year 2007/8 achievement fell below 90% of target and therefore no annual bonus is payable.
Co-Investment Plan
The Co-Investment Plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2005. As explained above, any annual bonus earned above 
target will be compulsorily deferred into shares held under this Plan.
The Executive Directors also have the opportunity to voluntarily defer additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 25% of basic salary 
into the Plan. 
Matching awards will then be made by the Company, at the rate of one for one, which will be subject to performance conditions measured over a 
period of three years. The relevant performance conditions are the same as those used for the Long-Term Performance Plan, and detailed below. 
As no bonus is payable for 2007/8 no Co-Investment Plan awards will be granted this year.
Long-Term Performance Plan 
The Long-Term Performance Plan (the  LTPP') was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2003 to take effect from 1 July 2003.
Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 200% of basic salary 
with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three-year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets. 
There is no retesting of performance conditions. 50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Basic Earnings Per 
Share ( EPS') growth and 50% based on Total Shareholder Return ( TSR'). 
For the award made in 2004 the targets were as follows: for the EPS element of the target the full 50% vested if EPS growth exceeded the Retail 
Price Index ( RPI') plus 45% and 10% vested if EPS growth exceeded the RPI plus 30%; for performance in between the award vested on a 
straight-line basis. The remaining 50% vested subject to TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE Construction and 
Building Materials Sector Index. A vesting schedule was established so that the full 50% vested if TSR growth was in the upper quartile of the 
comparator index and 10% vested if TSR growth was at the median of the index, with straight-line vesting between the two points.
For awards made in 2005, 2006 and 2007 the targets are as follows: for the EPS element of the target, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds 
the RPI plus 18% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 9%; for performance in between the awards will vest on a straight-line basis.
The TSR portion of the awards made in 2005 and 2006 use a peer group comprising listed housebuilders as follows: Berkeley Group, Bellway, 
Bovis Homes Group, Redrow, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey. For awards made in 2007 the comparator group for the TSR portion of the award 
comprises those companies ranked 51-100 in the FTSE Index.
 
A vesting schedule will be drawn up by taking an average of the two highest and two lowest TSR figures for such companies over the performance 
period and creating a mid-point and an upper-quartile from those two figures. The full 50% will vest if the Company's TSR is within the upper-quartile 
and 10% will vest at the mid-point mark; for performance in between, the award will vest on a straight-line basis.
The award made in 2005 was tested on 30 June 2008 and the required targets were not achieved, therefore none of this award will vest.
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the long-term share incentive schemes available to the Company. The Committee has concluded that in the 
current market in which the Company is operating a new Executive Share Option Scheme (the  Scheme') should be implemented. The grant of share 
options under the Scheme is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance 
of the Group. Options must normally be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised 
within ten years of grant. It is proposed that the exercise of options to be granted in 2008 will be subject to the achievement of an objective performance 
condition set by the Remuneration Committee based on Return On Capital Employed ( ROCE'). There will be no opportunity to retest any performance 
criteria. The ROCE performance condition will be underpinned by the requirement that the Committee is satisfied that vesting determined by the ROCE 
condition is such that it correctly reflects the underlying financial performance of the Company across the performance period. Shareholders' approval 
for the new Scheme will be sought at the AGM and details of the Scheme will be outlined in the Circular that accompanies the Notice of AGM. 40

Share Option Plan
In November 1997, the Company adopted an Executive Share Option Plan (the  Plan'). The grant of share options under the Plan is at the discretion  
of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options must be held for  
a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years. The exercise of options 
granted under the Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee.
No options have been granted under the Plan during the financial year. Options which have been granted in previous years remain unchanged  
and are set out on page 44. The award granted to Mr S J Boyes in 2003, vested in 2006 but has not been exercised and the awards granted  
to Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton in 2004 lapsed in 2007.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the provision of employee share incentive schemes available to the Company and has concluded that a 
Savings Related Share Option Scheme ( SAYE Scheme') should be implemented. Shareholders' approval for the new SAYE Scheme will be sought  
at the AGM and a summary of the main features of the SAYE Scheme will be set out in the Circular that accompanies the Notice of AGM.
Pension benefits 
Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton are members of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme, which is now closed to new entrants. The scheme 
entitles Mr S J Boyes to a pension on retirement at age 65 of two-thirds of final pensionable salary after 40 years' membership of the scheme. The 
Executive Directors are also eligible for dependants' pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on death in service.  
The final pension is calculated from the highest yearly average pensionable salary over three consecutive years during the last ten years of service.
The entitlement of Mr C Fenton is restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 1989, for service up to 5 April 2006. 
Following the introduction of the Lifetime Allowance Pension Rules on 6 April 2006 the Committee has agreed to make changes to the existing 
pension provision. With effect from 1 July 2006 all Executive Directors have and continue to have a choice of remaining in the defined benefit 
pension scheme as described above, or opting to leave this scheme and instead receive a cash supplement equal to 25% of their basic salary. This 
choice is at the discretion of the individual Executive Directors. In lieu of membership of the defined benefit scheme Mr M S Clare receives a cash 
supplement equal to 30% of base salary per annum, and Mr M A Pain receives a cash supplement equal to 25% of base salary per annum. These 
cash allowances are in line with competitive market practice.
Only the basic salary element of a Director's remuneration is pensionable.
Service contracts 
Executive Directors are engaged on the basis of one-year rolling contracts which can be terminated by twelve months notice given by the  
Company or by twelve months notice given by the Executive at any time. There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination 
or loss of office due to a takeover bid. The contracts entitle Executive Directors to the provision of a company car and membership of a private 
healthcare scheme.
Individual Executive Director's service contracts:
Executive Director Service contract date  Effective date  Notice period
Mr M S Clare 27 June 2006  2 October 2006  12 months
Mr S J Boyes 25 June 2001  1 July 2001  12 months
Mr C Fenton 1 July 2003  1 July 2003  12 months
Mr M A Pain 23 January 2006  1 March 2006  12 months 41

Directors' own contributions have been deducted from the change in the transfer value over the year, calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance 
Note GN11.
The figures do not take account of any retained benefits the members may have.
The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the Director would have accrued if he left the scheme at the end of the year. The Listing Rules 
require this to be disclosed excluding inflation.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the end of the year and that at the previous year-end.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. The transfer values of 
the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring 
the scheme's liability in respect of the Directors' pension benefits. They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, 
cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The actuarial basis and assumptions used to calculate the transfer values changed in October 2007. The new basis results in higher transfer values 
at the 2008 year-end than at the 2007 year-end.

The performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee for the award granted in 2003, that the growth in earnings per share of the Company 
over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the RPI by at least 9%, was met in 2006, but the option has not yet 
been exercised. The performance condition for the award granted in 2004, which was the same as the performance condition set for the award 
granted in 2003, was tested in 2007 and the required targets were not met therefore the award lapsed. 
The mid-market share price of the Company was 1,000p on 2 July 2007 and 58p as at 30 June 2008. The mid-market high and low share prices of 
the Company during the year were 1,031p and 58p respectively. 
There were no changes in the interests of the Directors shown above between 30 June 2008 and 9 September 2008.
