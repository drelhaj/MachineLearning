1. Introduction
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board on all
matters relating to the remuneration arrangements applying to the executive directors, the management
population occupying roles immediately below those of the Board and to any other employee within the
Group whose salary plus bonus potential exceeds a specified amount, currently  180,000 per annum.
During the year under review the Committee met on six occasions and each Committee member attended
all meetings.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee is limited to the independent non-executive directors and,
following the retirement of Mr M J Allen on 30 June 2005, has been chaired by Mrs A V M Palmer. The
other current members of the Committee are Mr S G Batey and Mr N P Buckles who was appointed to the
Committee on 18 October 2005 following his appointment as a Non-Executive Director on 19 July 2005. 
Sir Richard Broadbent sat as a member of the Committee until May 2005. In his capacity as Senior
Independent Director, Mr S G Williams (appointed to the Board on 1 September 2005 and appointed Senior
Independent Director on 18 October 2005) may attend any meeting of the Committee. During the year
under review Sir Richard Broadbent and Mr R J Davies have attended meetings of the Committee as
invitees.
The Committee's terms of reference are available on the company's website www.arriva.co.uk
2. Remuneration Review
The Committee decided in 2005 to undertake a comprehensive review of executive remuneration which
had operated within the same framework since 2000. In addition to ensuring that its remuneration practices
remained competitive, the Committee was asked by the Board to ensure that the remuneration structure
was fully aligned with the company's business goals. The Committee appointed KPMG LLP (UK) as advisors
to assist in the review. When undertaking the review, the Remuneration Committee has consulted with
certain of the company's major shareholders, as well as with the Association of British Insurers.
The objective of the Board's remuneration policy is to ensure that senior management of appropriate calibre
and experience are attracted, motivated and retained to provide the best possible opportunity for the
company to deliver sustained shareholder value. In support of this objective, the remuneration review
confirmed the company's policy of paying basic salary at the median of the peer comparator group and to
reward outstanding performance with upper quartile total remuneration.
The review based its conclusions on a peer comparator group comprising a representative sample of FTSE 250
companies of a similar size and complexity to that of the company from the transport and other sectors.
The main conclusions of the review were as follows; further details are provided in section 3 below:
  The salary of the Group Managing Director - Finance should be re-aligned by 16 per cent to bring it
in line with the median of the peer group 
  The annual performance-related bonus opportunity should be increased to 100 per cent of salary with
70 per cent dependent on financial performance and 30 per cent on personal targets
  The maximum number of shares conditionally awarded under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
should be increased to an amount equivalent to 200 per cent of salary  based on stretching new
performance targets linked to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance and earnings per share
(EPS) growth, in line with our strategic ambitions.
  Share retention guidelines for executive directors should be introduced requiring retention of 50 per
cent of any share award until a holding equivalent in value to annual base salary has been achieved.
The effect of these changes is to ensure that compensation opportunity matches the comparator peer group
subject to achieving stretching performance in line with our strategic goals.
For the purposes of this remuneration report, EPS means basic earnings per share before goodwill impairment
and intangible asset amortisation calculated under International Financial Reporting Standards adjusted for
exceptional items.

3. Remuneration Structure
3.1 Base Salary
Following its review of remuneration the Committee concluded that the base salary of the Group Managing
Director - Finance was below that of the median of the peer comparator group and that the remaining
executive directors' base salaries were appropriately positioned. Accordingly the following salaries proposed
by the Committee, effective from 1 January 2006, were approved by the Board.
Salary
 000 p.a.
R J Davies 447
D R Martin 312
S P Lonsdale 290
S J Clayton 260
Mr R J Davies will retire from the Board on 19 April and there are no exceptional arrangements applying to
his retirement. Mr D R Martin will assume the role of Chief Executive on 19 April 2006 and his base salary
will be increased to  447,000 p.a. in line with that of Mr Davies' final salary.
3.2 Performance-Related Bonus
3.2.1 Year to 31 December 2005
For the year under review each of the executive directors participated in a performance-related bonus
scheme. Mr R J Davies was targeted on group profitability performance against budget, with performance
equal to budget delivering a bonus of 50 per cent of base salary and profit performance up to 10 per cent
in excess of budget delivering bonus pro rata up to a maximum of 70 per cent of basic salary; performance
of 90 per cent-100 per cent of budget delivering pro rata bonus of 25 per cent-50 per cent of base salary.
The bonus arrangements for Messrs Clayton, Lonsdale and Martin are based on both Group profitability and
the achievement of personal objectives and for outstanding performance could deliver a maximum bonus of
60 per cent of basic salary. The financial element was based on a single objective of Group performance by
reference to budgeted earnings per share (EPS) and for the year under review was targeted to deliver 30 per
cent of base salary at EPS of 43 pence and capped at a maximum of 40 per cent of basic salary on the
achievement of EPS of 46 pence; below EPS of 43 pence, linearly from 0 per cent of basic salary at 40
pence, to 30 per cent at 43 pence.
The personal objectives element which was agreed with each director at the beginning of the year had 
the potential to deliver a maximum bonus of 20 per cent of basic salary in the year under review. 
These non-financial objectives set for each director focus on the key themes of strategy, organisational
development, business growth, the establishment and maintenance of effective relationships and leadership.
3.2.2 Arrangements from 1 January 2006
Following the results of the remuneration review the annual bonus opportunity will increase to 100 per 
cent of base salary with 70 per cent being determined by Group financial performance and the balance
reflecting performance against personal objectives agreed with each director at the beginning of the year.
Performance will be measured against budget and personal objectives with  on target' performance delivering
50 per cent of base salary as bonus; profit performance exceeding budget by 10 per cent coupled with
outstanding personal performance will deliver a maximum bonus of 100 per cent of basic salary. 
The performance measure will generally be EPS, although the Remuneration Committee will review the
measure each year to ensure it remains appropriate.
3.3 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
3.3.1 Year to 31 December 2005
The existing LTIP was introduced in 2000 and provides for the conditional award of shares at the discretion
of the Board as advised by the Remuneration Committee. The market value of any conditional award is
restricted such that it may not exceed 100 per cent of a director's basic salary as at the date of grant. The
vesting of the conditional share awards will depend upon the performance of the Group's EPS (before
goodwill impairment, intangible asset amortisation and exceptional items) when compared with the growth
in the Retail Price Index and also of the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Group when compared with
the TSR of the Peer Comparator Group (comprising the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 excluding
the Group and investment companies) over a period of three years.  Arriva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005  33
www.arriva.co.uk
The degree of vesting is on a sliding scale of 25 per cent to 100 per cent, with no share vesting unless the TSR of the Group is at least equal to
the median TSR of the Peer Comparator Group. However, irrespective of TSR performance, no share shall vest in any event unless the growth in
the Group's EPS over the three year measurement period exceeds the growth of the Retail Price Index in the same period by at least 6 per cent.
The awards were originally made with performance targets based on accounting standards prevailing at the time and in particular before the
introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards. The Remuneration Committee has made appropriate adjustments to target EPS to
ensure proper comparability.
With regard to the conditional share award made on 6 March 2003 the performance measurement period is the three years ended 31 December
2005; in that period the growth in the Group's EPS was 28.6 per cent compared with the growth in the Retail Price Index of 9 per cent. The
Group's TSR for the same period fell between the TSR of the bottom company in the upper quartile and that of the top company in the second
quartile, delivering a conditional award vesting level of 99.75 per cent.
3.3.2 Proposed arrangements post 1 January 2006 (subject to shareholder approval)
  It is proposed that the maximum LTIP award an employee may receive in any year be increased from 100 per cent to 200 per cent of the
participant's annual salary. The Remuneration Committee believes that this amendment is necessary to ensure that participants are
provided with upper quartile reward opportunity for upper quartile performance. To ensure that the performance targets are sufficiently
stretching, and are in line with the company's business strategy, it is also proposed that the performance condition attaching to new LTIP
awards be amended. 
  Currently the performance condition attaching to LTIP awards is based on the total shareholder return (TSR) when compared to the FTSE
250 (excluding investment companies) and earnings per share. Although TSR is an important measure of shareholder value, the
Remuneration Committee also believes there should be a direct link between the efforts of the management team and the delivery of the
business strategy. To achieve this link it is proposed that: 50 per cent of the LTIP award be based on the company's TSR performance
(referred to as the TSR Element ), and 50 per cent of the LTIP award be based on the company's growth in earnings per share (EPS) over
the performance period (the EPS Element ).
  The TSR Element will not vest if, when compared to the group of comparator companies, the company's TSR is less than median. 25 per
cent of the TSR Element will vest if, when compared to the group of comparator companies, the company's TSR is at median. 100 per cent
of the TSR Element will vest if, when compared to the group of comparator companies, the company's TSR is in the upper quartile. The
TSR Element will vest on a straight line basis if the company's TSR is between median and upper quartile. Vesting will also be subject to the
Remuneration Committee confirming that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the
company over the performance period.
As at 31 December 2005 the interests of the directors in conditional share awards made under the LTIP were as follows (audited information):

  The EPS Element will not vest if the compound annual growth rate in EPS over the performance period is less than compound annual
growth in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus 4 per cent. 10 per cent of the EPS element will vest if the compound annual growth rate in EPS
over the performance period is equal to the compound annual growth in RPI plus 4 per cent. 100 per cent of the EPS element will vest if
the compound annual growth rate in EPS over the performance period is equal to the compound annual growth in RPI plus 13 per cent or
more. The EPS Element will vest on a straight line basis for compound annual growth in earnings per share over the performance period
which is between (i) compound annual growth in RPI plus 4 per cent and (ii) compound annual growth in RPI plus 13 per cent.
3.4 Share Options (audited information)
Since the introduction of the LTIP in 2000 the executive directors have not participated in any of the company's share option schemes and it is not
envisaged that there will be any change to this policy in the future.
As at 1 January 2005 Mr R J Davies had residual interests in the company's share option schemes (which had been awarded to him in 1998) and
were exercised during the year as follows:
The exercise of the share options held by Mr Davies was subject to the achievement of performance targets which require the company's
earnings per share over a period of three consecutive years prior to exercise to exceed the Retail Prices Index by a minimum of 2 per cent per
annum. The targets are set by the Remuneration Committee and may be varied from time to time. 
No other director held any interest in any of the share option schemes (other than the LTIP) during the course of the year.

3.6 Non-Executive Directors' Fees
The non-executive directors' fees are currently limited by the Articles of Association to  400,000 per annum in the aggregate and the Articles
permit the directors to increase this cap annually in line with the index of wage inflation. Within the aggregate cap the annual fee for each non-
executive director is determined by the Board, the non-executive directors taking no part in the deliberations. With effect from 1 March 2005, the
fee payable to each of the non-executive directors (excluding the Chairman) was increased by  4,000 to  32,500 per annum; these changes
were made to ensure that the fees remained in line with fees paid by comparable companies. Responsibility for chairing a Board Committee or
occupying the role of Senior Independent Director attracts a further annual fee of  3,000 except for the Audit Committee Chairmanship where
the additional annual fee is  7,500. Since March 2005 there have been no changes to the fees payable to the non-executive directors. The fee
for the Chairman has also remained unchanged.
Each of the non-executive directors is appointed for a fixed term not exceeding three years. The appointments are renewable with the agreement
of both parties again for terms not exceeding three years.

Since 1 January 2000 Messrs Clayton, Lonsdale and Martin have, subject to Inland Revenue limits, been accruing benefits in their respective schemes
at 1/30th of basic annual salary; for service after 31 December 1999 bonus ceased to be taken into account when computing pension benefits. 
With effect from 6 April 2006, the basis on which pension benefits are taxed will change with the introduction of lifetime and annual allowances.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the position and, having taken advice from KPMG LLP (UK), has established the following policy:
  Any change to the taxation of pensions benefits remains the responsibility of the individual concerned and the company should not incur
any additional cost as a result of the change
  All future executive director appointees to the board will not be eligible for a final salary based pension, but will receive a cash contribution
equivalent to 25% of their base salary.
6. Service Contracts
Messrs Clayton, Lonsdale and Martin each have rolling service contracts which are subject to 12 months' notice from the company and six
months' notice from the director; Mr Lonsdale's contract is dated 5 September 1997 and the contracts for Messrs Clayton and Martin are dated
19 November 2001. Each of their contracts contains an explicit provision for compensation payment on termination, except in the case of
misconduct, with the severance payment being calculated as the sum of the following:
(i) Basic annual salary at the date of termination
(ii) The amount of bonus estimated to be payable to the director in the year notice is served 
(iii) The amount representing the value of 12 months' benefit in kind as recorded in the audited accounts of the company for the financial year
immediately preceding the date of termination.
Additionally the company will secure a further 12 months' service credit in respect of the directors' pension scheme membership.
Should the director give notice to the company within the period of six months following a change of control of the company to terminate the
contract, one half of the payments referred to above shall be payable by the company.
Mr Davies will retire from the Board on 19 April 2006 following the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting. There are no compensation
payments that will be made to Mr Davies in this regard, Mr Davies receiving salary and pro rata bonus up to the date of retirement. Arriva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005  37
www.arriva.co.uk
7. External Appointments
The Board is generally happy for executive directors to accept one appointment outside the company. Before
accepting such appointments, the director involved must receive the prior approval of the Board. In
considering such cases the Board will always satisfy itself, as far as is possible, that such appointments will
not detract from the executive directors' expected contribution to the company or create any conflict of
interest. Any fees earned by an executive director in such a capacity will be assigned to the company as in
the case of Mr R J Davies' appointment as a non-executive director of Barratt Developments PLC, where the
annual fee of  34,320 ( 33,000 to 30 June 2005) is paid directly to the company on a quarterly basis.
