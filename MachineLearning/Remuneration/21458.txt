Babcock International Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2006
Remuneration report
This report sets out the company's policy on the remuneration of its Directors, which it followed for the year under review and
currently intends to follow for the present financial year and subsequent years. It also provides details of the Directors' remuneration
packages and contracts. The report will be submitted for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the company in
July 2006.
Remuneration Committee
Responsibility for determining and approving the remuneration packages of the executive Directors and certain other senior group
executives has been delegated by the Board to a Remuneration Committee ( the Committee') consisting solely of non-executive
Directors of the company. Those Directors who served on the Committee during the year under review, were:
D J Shah (Committee Chairman since 19 July 2005)
J L Rennocks
Sir Nigel Essenhigh
The Rt Hon Lord Hesketh (Chairman and member of the Committee 1 April - 18 July 2005)
M J Turner (1 April - 18 July 2005)
J N A Crookenden (from 1 December 2005)
Biographical details of the members of the Committee are set out on page 24.
The Committee invites Mr Campbell and Mr Rogers to attend meetings in their capacities as Chairman and Group Chief
Executive respectively, but neither is present when their own remuneration is under discussion. The Company Secretary attends 
as Secretary to the Committee. Lord Hesketh has attended meetings of the Committee since 18 July 2005 as an observer. 
The Committee has access to market research on remuneration. In addition to receiving recommendations from Mr Campbell 
and Mr Rogers (other than in respect of their own remuneration), the Committee receives advice on executive Director remuneration
(including on share schemes and long-term incentive plans) from Inbucon Limited (Inbucon ), remuneration consultants. Advice is 
also taken on share schemes from Pinsent Masons, Solicitors. Pinsent Masons also provides other legal advice to the Company, but
Inbucon does not provide other services to group companies. Both firms have been appointed for these purposes, with the
Committee's approval, by the company (acting through the Group Company Secretary). During the year a full review of 
Chairman, executive Director and senior executive remuneration was commissioned directly from Inbucon by Mr Shah (the
Remuneration Committee Chairman)
Remuneration policy
Basic policy
The remuneration policy of the Committee is normally to provide executive Directors and senior executives with basic remuneration
packages that, looked at as a whole, are competitive having regard to companies of a similar size in business sectors in which the
group operates. This involves generally positioning basic pay at or about median with the potential, through incentive schemes, for
upper quartile pay for upper quartile performance. 
Remuneration packages for executive Directors consist, to varying degrees as between individuals, of fixed elements - basic
salary, pension entitlements and typical benefits in kind - and performance-related elements - annual bonus schemes (linked 
to company and/or personal performance) and share-based or share-related long-term incentive schemes, including (until 2003) 
grants of options under share option schemes and (from 2003) awards of shares under the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (L-TIP).
This report describes the various elements of the packages for each of Mr Campbell, Mr Rogers and Mr T ame for the year under review. 
For the year, the performance-related elements of their packages consisted, for Mr Rogers and Mr T ame, of annual bonus
schemes (the value of which was capped as described below) and, for each of Mr Campbell, Mr Rogers and Mr T ame, of share awards
under the L-TIP. The Committee is sensitive to the need to set Directors' remuneration having regard to pay and conditions in the
group as a whole and is satisfied that the approach taken by the company is fair and reasonable, compatible with current market
practice and in the best interest of the shareholders. 
Performance-related rewards:
Annual bonus schemes:
The Remuneration Committee determines a performance-related annual bonus scheme for Mr Rogers and Mr T ame at the
beginning of each financial year. For the year ended 31 March 2006 the annual bonus payable to them was dependent on the 
profit before tax (pre-exceptionals and acquired intangibles amortisation) achieved by the group as against budget. Maximum
bonus potential was 40% of basic salary for 10% out-performance of budget, plus up to a further 10% of basic salary for personal
performance. The maximum potential annual bonus for each of them was, therefore, 50% of basic salary.
Given the Company's policy of maintaining competitiveness by setting basic remuneration at or around median, but allowing
for top quartile performance to deliver top quartile rewards, the Remuneration Committee directly commissioned Inbucon in late
2005 to prepare a review of executive remuneration to test whether the policy was being borne out in practice. The review
confirmed that the basic salary of the executive Directors was in accordance with this policy having regard to pay in FTSE 250
companies and comparable companies, but found that restricting the existing maximum annual bonus potential for Mr Rogers 
and Mr T ame to 50% represented only lower quartile practice, and that therefore the company's bonus practice did not meet the
company's policy. For the financial year commencing on 1 April 2006, the Remuneration Committee has, therefore, decided to
increase the maximum annual bonus potential for Mr Rogers and Mr T ame to 100% and 80% respectively. The bonus will also now
focus on delivering growth rather than merely performance against budget. Maximum bonus will only be payable if the growth 
in the group's profit before tax (before amortisation of acquired intangibles, but normally after exceptional items) is at least 20%.
The Health and Safety performance of the group in the year will also be considered by the Committee, which has discretion to
reduce the level of bonus otherwise payable if it considers it appropriate to do so in the light of that performance.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
Long-term incentives:
Since 1 April 2003 executive share options are no longer granted to executive Directors: they receive awards under the L-TIP, further
information about which appears below.  Share options:
Executive Directors hold share options granted before April 2003 under the Babcock 1999 Approved Executive Share Option
Scheme and the Babcock 1999 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme ( the 1999 Schemes') and, in the case of Mr Campbell
and Mr Rogers, under option agreements (described further on page 37), which were subject to performance criteria as 
described later in this report. 
Details of executive share options and share awards under the L-TIP already granted to Directors are set out in the tables on
page 37 .
Relative importance of variable and fixed pay
For the year under review, variable, performance-related remuneration (namely annual bonus and new share awards under the L-TIP)
represented approximately 43% of the total remuneration package for Mr Rogers and Mr T ame, if minimum 25% vesting of the
share awards is achieved and the share price on vesting is the same as at the date of the award. If there is maximum vesting of the
share awards made in the year and the value of the shares increases, the proportion of remuneration represented by variable pay
increases. For example, if all the shares vest and the share price on vesting is at the level it was on 31 March 2006 (318.75p), the
proportion of pay for the year under review that was performance related increases to approximately 70%. In the case of Mr
Campbell the equivalent proportions are 20% and 65% respectively. On the basis of the revised annual bonus schemes for the
current year the potential proportion of variable pay for Mr Rogers and Mr T ame will increase given the increase in the maximum
potential annual bonus.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (L-TIP)
In 2003 shareholders approved the establishment of a long-term incentive plan (L-TIP) under which share-based awards may 
be made to executive Directors and other senior executives. Awards made under the L-TIP can be made as rights (structured as 
nil-cost options) to acquire shares, granted either by the company or by the trustees of The Babcock Employees' Share Trust or the
Peterhouse Employee Benefit Trust acting on the recommendation of the Committee.
Under the L-TIP, executive Directors and other selected senior executives may be awarded each year conditional entitlements 
to shares in the company ( Award Shares') or to a cash sum whose value is linked to a notional award of Award Shares. It is policy 
that such awards are made only to executive Directors of the company and a limited number of other senior executives who are 
key to the group. The initial market value of the shares over which any such award is made in any year may be up to 100% of the
amount of the participant's basic annual salary at the date of grant (save as may be adjusted to reflect the payment of employer's
National Insurance). 
Performance targets: L-TIP share awards and Option Grants under the 1999 Schemes
Performance targets set by the Committee for options and share awards have regard to market conditions and the need to ensure
that they serve the purpose of motivating and retaining key staff. Vesting of share awards or option grants depends on the extent to
which the targets are met or exceeded.
For both share awards under the L-TIP and option grants under the 1999 Schemes the performance is judged over the period of
three financial years commencing with the financial year in which the award is made or option granted. Performance is measured as
at the end of the period. There is no retesting of performance.
Performance measures - share awards under the L-TIP
For share awards made in 2003 there could be no vesting unless the company's earnings per share (pre-acquired intangible
amortisation and exceptional items) in the year ended 31 March 2006 was at least 9.27% (representing a 3% per annum compound
growth rate) greater than the basic earnings per share (pre-acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items) for the financial
year ended 31 March 2003. Once this hurdle is achieved, actual levels of vesting depend on the comparative total shareholder
return (TSR ) performance of the company as at 31 March 2006 against the shares of the companies comprising the FTSE All-Share
Index (other than Investment Trusts) on 1 April 2003. This was selected as being a broad index at a time when the Company had 
left the Engineering and Machinery Sector, but its transition to a broader based support services company was not yet complete.
The target provided for no vesting for at or below median ranking, 25% vesting for immediately above median ranking and 100%
vesting for top quartile ranking (with proportionate straight-line vesting in between). 
Having completed its transition to a more broadly based support services company, and as explained in the company's
Remuneration report for 2005, the company adopted a new more closely identified comparator group and took a new approach
to the structuring of share awards under the L-TIP made in 2005 and adjusted the performance target attached to the share awards
made in 2004 to reflect this new approach. Half of each such award will vest according to comparative TSR performance measured
against a specified list of companies with similar businesses (see below) and half according to growth in earnings per share. 
This approach will be taken with any share awards made under the L-TIP in the current financial year. 
For the half of the share award for which vesting depends on comparative TSR performance a ranking immediately above 
the median level in the comparator table would result in 25% of those shares vesting (there would be no vesting for ranking at or
below median), and a ranking in the top quartile would result in 100% vesting. Rankings between these threshold levels would result
in proportionate vesting calculated on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%. The comparator group of listed companies for 
the 2004 and 2005 awards (and (apart from PHS Group) for any awards made in the current financial year) is:
AEA Technology, W.S. Atkins, Aggreko, Amec, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, Cobham, Interserve, Laing (John), Mitie, 
Mouchel-Parkman, PHS Group, Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group, and WSP Group.
These companies were selected in consultation with Inbucon as being an appropriate range of support services providers
against which to compare the company given the nature of its and their businesses. 
For the half of the share awards for which vesting depends on earnings per share growth, 25% of those shares will vest if
growth (adjusted to exclude exceptional items and acquired intangible amortisation), over the performance period is equivalent to 
a real (i.e. in excess of the growth in the consumer prices index) compound annual growth rate of 4%, with full vesting if this reaches
8%. Vesting will be on a straight-line basis for growth between those two points. There is no vesting for compound annual earnings 
per share growth of below 4%. International Financial Reporting Standards are taken into account in both the opening position
(which may have to be restated accordingly) and the assessment of performance.
Performance measures - share options
Options granted under the 1999 Schemes were made subject to a comparative TSR performance over the performance 
period. For options granted before 2003 the comparator group was the companies who at the date of grant comprised the FTSE
Engineering and Machinery Sector, in which the company then appeared. For option grants in 2003, made after the company had
left the Engineering and Machinery Sector, the comparator group was all those companies comprising the FTSE All-Share Index
(other than investment trusts) at the start of the performance period. There would be no vesting unless the company's ranking at 
the end of the performance period was at least immediately above median in which case 25% of the options would vest, with 100%
vesting for top quartile ranking and proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis for a ranking between those points.
Share options granted in 2004 (not applicable to Directors) have, following an adjustment made in 2005, a performance test
consisting solely of the eps test now used for share awards under the L-TIP made in that year. There were no grants of share options
in 2005 and it is not currently the intention to make any further option grants under the 1999 Schemes. 
Further details of the rules of the L-TIP and the 1999 Schemes are set out below the tables on page 37.

Performance graphs
The first graph below, compiled by Inbucon, shows the total shareholder return for a holding in the company's shares for the period
from 31 March 2001 to 31 March 2006 relative to a holding of shares representing the FTSE All-Share Index (excluding investment
trusts). This is the same index as has been used for this purpose in earlier Remuneration reports, being a broad index that allows
comparison of the company's performance against the performance of the stock market as a whole. 
The graph below shows comparative TSR performance against the FTSE Support Services Sector, the sector in which the
company's share price is reported:
Directors' pensions
Executive Directors of the company are eligible for membership, by invitation, of the company's defined benefit pension plan.
Only Mr T ame currently participates in the scheme.
The accrual rate for Mr T ame under the Scheme is one-thirtieth for each year of service, with pension being calculated on his
base salary (up to the earnings cap ) in the 12 months prior to attaining age 60. Membership of the Scheme also entitles him to 
life assurance cover of four times base salary up to the earnings cap. For these purposes the earnings cap  means the statutory
earnings cap that applied up to 5 April 2006 and, thereafter, the earnings cap adopted by the Scheme as part of its rules (which will
be the same as the former statutory earnings cap and index-linked in the same way). In respect of his salary in excess of the earnings
cap, the company established a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS) into which it contributed 20% of the excess
(after employer's national insurance contributions), with Mr T ame making contributions into the company's pension scheme on 
his full uncapped salary. As from April 2006 this has been replaced with a salary supplement of 15% of the excess (less employers'
national insurance contributions), with Mr T ame contributing into the company's pension scheme only on capped salary. The cost 
to the company of each arrangement is the same. The company takes out additional life assurance cover in respect of four times his
salary in excess of the earnings cap. 
Neither Mr Campbell nor Mr Rogers receives pensions benefits from the company, and their salaries take this into account.
The company's policy is to remain competitive in the market place to attract and retain the calibre of employee it needs.
Subject to that, it is not the company's policy to compensate employees for tax changes arising from the changes to the taxation 
of pensions.
A summary of Directors' pension entitlements is set out at page 36.
Non-executive Directors
It is currently company policy that non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the company's share, pension or bonus
schemes. They are remunerated solely by fees that are reviewed against market practice at least every three years by the executive
Directors, to whom the task has been delegated by the Board.

(1) Inflation has been taken as 3.0% for the purposes of calculating increases in transfer values and pension earned.
(2) The transfer value of the increase in pension accrued is calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN1 1, and is
stated after deducting members' contributions. 
(3) The figures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benefits under the Scheme.
(4) The figures in the above table make no allowance for any benefits in respect of earnings in excess of the Inland Revenue 
earnings cap.
(5) If any member has significant benefits retained in any pension scheme provided by previous employers then the pension
entitlements shown above may be restricted to a lower amount and the figures may need to be reduced accordingly. In calculating
the above figures for Mr W T ame no account has been taken of any retained benefits which he may have.
(6) No payments have been made to retired Directors in excess of the retirement benefit to which they were entitled on the date the
benefits first became payable or, if later, 31 March 1997 .

a = Share Option Agreement (agreed as part of the terms of recruitment). Whilst, in each case, the Agreement originally allowed for
full vesting on a change of control, this is no longer relevant as the options have now vested in accordance with the performance
targets following the completion of the relevant performance period. In all other respects each Agreement essentially mirrored the
terms of the 1999 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme, including as to using the same performance tests as applied at the
time it was made. 
b = Babcock 1999 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme
c = Babcock 1999 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme
During the year, Mr Campbell exercised options in respect of 22,349 shares granted under the Babcock Approved Executive
Share Option Scheme, at an option exercise price of 99.33p per share. The mid-market closing price for the shares on the date he
exercised the options was 239.5p. The shares obtained on the exercise of the options were sold on the same day at a price of 240.75p.
The exercise prices of the options held by the Directors were not set at a discount to the market value of the company's shares
at the date of grant. They were set at the average of the mid-market quotations of a share as shown by the London Stock Exchange
Daily Official List for the three dealing days immediately preceding the grant dates.
Directors must exercise vested options before the tenth anniversaries of the grant dates, or earlier if there is a change of
control, they leave or die, failing which they will lapse.

The awards were made, by the trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust, as conditional rights to acquire shares (effectively nil
cost options), and the number of shares awarded was based on the average of the mid-market closing price of the company's shares
for the three business days preceding the date of the award. For each of Mr Rogers and Mr T ame the value of the awards on grant
was equivalent to his annual basic salary at the date of grant. For Mr Campbell the award in 2003 was equivalent to his annual salary
as part-time Chairman from 1 August 2003. The value of his awards in 2004 and 2005 was equivalent to his annual salary at the
date of the awards. Subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria (see page 34) attached to the awards, the Directors may call
for the release to them of the shares subject to the award during the above shown exercise periods. Subject to the rules of the plan,
an earlier release of shares may be allowed by the Remuneration Committee (for example, in the event of a cessation of
employment or a change in control), but normally of not more than a time-apportioned proportion and then only having regard to
the company's performance, though the Committee has discretion to allow a greater proportion to be released.
There were no changes in the current Directors' share options or share awards between 31 March 2006 and 22 May 2006.
The company's mid-market share price at close of business on 31 March 2006 was 318.75p. The highest and lowest mid-market
share prices in the year ended 31 March 2006 were 327 .25p and 1 31.0p respectively. Service contracts
The following table sets out a summary of the Directors' service contracts or terms of appointment.
Executive Directors
Name Date of service contract Unexpired term Notice period
G A Campbell 31 July 2003 1 2 months 12 months from company, 6 months from Director
(amended by letters 
dated 5 May 2004 
and 3 April 2006)
P L Rogers 31 July 2003 1 2 months 1 2 months from company, 6 months from Director

and 3 April 2006) 
W T ame 20 September 2001 1 2 months 1 2 months from company, 6 months from Director
(amended by letters
dated 5 May 2004 
and 3 April 2006)
The company's policy for executive Directors' service contracts is that they be capable of being terminated by the company on 
not more than 12 months' notice, and for the company to reserve the right to terminate those contracts without full notice by
payment of basic salary in lieu of notice. If the company terminates a Director's service contract (other than following a change 
of control - see below - or by the exercise of the company's option to pay salary in lieu of notice) the company will have regard 
to all the circumstances in determining the amount of compensation, if any, payable to him in connection with that termination.
Although the agreements for Mr Campbell, Mr Rogers and Mr T ame contain provisions relating to a change of control, as described
below, the company believes that they do no more than reflect what would in effect be a likely outcome in practice for these
executive positions following a change of control. The provisions are as follows. The contracts provide that within 90 days of the
occurrence of the change of control the executive Director may terminate his employment forthwith. If he exercises this right, he
will, however, only be entitled to be paid, for up to a period of 1 2 months, on a monthly basis, his basic salary (plus, in the case of 
Mr Rogers and Mr T ame, 40% in lieu of bonus and all other contractual entitlements) but any amount that they receive by way of
income from other sources within that 12 month period, if it exceeds 10% of their salary, that they would not have been able to earn
had they continued in employment with the company is deductible from the amounts otherwise payable by the company. If the
company terminates the Director's appointment within 12 months of a change of control, the Director is entitled to a termination
payment equal to 100% of his annual salary (plus, in the case of Mr Rogers and Mr T ame, an additional 40% in lieu of bonus and all
other benefits).

For non-executive Directors the company's policy is to have written terms of appointment, with initial appointments normally being
for a three-year term, though in all cases appointments are terminable at will by the company. Non-executive Directors are free to
resign at any time. The written terms of appointment are available for inspection at the company's registered office and at the
company's Annual General Meeting. The expected time commitment of non-executive Directors is either set out in their current
written terms of appointment or is known, by experience, to the Directors concerned. 
Outside directorships
The company considers that it can benefit if a Director, executive or non-executive, holds directorships in other companies outside
the group. Before taking up any new outside appointment, a Director must first seek the approval of the Board. Any fees for outside
appointments are retained by the Director. During the year, Mr T ame became a non-executive director of Carclo PLC. Any fees earned
by him from that appointment are retained by him. Mr Campbell is employed by the company in a part-time capacity only and his
earnings from any non-executive directorships in other companies held by him are earned in time not committed to the company.
