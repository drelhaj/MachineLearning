Remuneration Report 
 
 
The Remuneration Committee 
 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of the Executive Directors and sets the scale and 
structure of their remuneration including bonus arrangements.  The membership of the Committee comprises 
Clive Donner as Chairman together with Karl Watkin and Evan Kirby. 
 
Frank Vanspeybroeck and Marinko Vidovich (via companies connected to them) have fixed term two year service 
agreements with Global Resource Ventures Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) to secure their 
services and expertise which, in each case, expire on 30 January 2008.  The lack of ability to terminate by notice 
means that neither of those agreements comply with the recommended notice periods for the directors set out in 
the Combined Code.  The Remuneration Committee has considered the terms of these agreements and due to 
the nature of the business consider them appropriate.  It is the intention of Frank Vanspeybroeck and Marinko 
Vidovich to reinstate their service agreements. 
 
In addition, Frank Vanspeybroeck and Marinko Vidovich have service agreements with the Company that are 
terminable on six month s notice.
