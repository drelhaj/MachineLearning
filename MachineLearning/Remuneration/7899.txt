2 Roger McDowell was appointed a member of the Committee on 1 October 2012.
3 By invitation.
Biographical details of members of the Committee appear on 
pages 20 and 21.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference and 
meets as required to:
 Make recommendations to the Board on the broad policy and 
framework for executive directors' remuneration and its cost; 
and
 Determine the total remuneration package and contractual 
terms for each of the executive directors.
It is also responsible for overseeing the management and 
administration of the Group's remuneration and share schemes 
for employees, including the award of share option and 
performance share entitlements.
The members of the Committee do not have any personal 
financial interests, other than as shareholders, or any conflicts 
from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in the running 
of the Group.
The Committee has access to independent external advisers on all 
remuneration-related issues and may obtain advice in determining 
individual remuneration levels from remuneration consultants 
appointed by the Committee. The results of market surveys and 
other analysis from external sources are also made available to the 
Committee. When appropriate, the Committee invites the views of 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance Director, but they are 
not involved in discussions concerning their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy designed to:
 Attract, retain and motivate the high calibre professional, 
managerial and technological expertise necessary to realise  
the Group's business objectives without paying excessively;
 Ensure that the remuneration framework and the constituent 
reward elements are competitive and fairly reflect, as 
necessary, the nature and complexity of the Group's business 
and the markets within which the Group operates;
 In general terms, set base salary broadly in line with median 
market practice, whilst achieving higher earnings by linking 
cash incentive packages (e.g. bonuses) and share options to 
superior performance;
 Create overall remuneration packages in which performance-
related elements form a significant proportion; and
 Maintain the correct balance and linkage between individual 
and business performance so as to effectively align the 
interests of directors and senior management with those of 
shareholders, particularly that of enhancing shareholder value.
Elements of remuneration
Each executive director's remuneration package consists of the 
following elements:
 Basic salary and benefits;
 Benefits in kind;
 Performance-related bonus;
 Pensions and life assurance arrangements; and
 Share options and long-term share incentives.
Full details of the directors' remuneration for the year ended 
31 December 2012 are set out on pages 33 to 35.
Basic salary
Basic salary for each executive director is reviewed annually taking 
into account assessments of the overall Company performance, 
the director's personal performance, experience and changing 
responsibilities and the median market position (against 
businesses of similar size and complexity). Account is also taken 
of salary levels and employment conditions across the Group.
Benefits in kind
Other corporate benefits play a role in ensuring the competitiveness 
of overall remuneration arrangements. The most significant 
benefits agreed by the Committee are car allowance (where there 
are ceilings on expenditure) and the provision of insurance policies 
providing cover for health care. In addition, the Company pays 
certain motoring and accommodation expenses for Neil O'Brien. 
Benefits are valued in accordance with HMRC rules.
Performance-related bonus
The Company has a performance-related bonus scheme under 
which staff were eligible for a maximum bonus of 50% basic 
salary for executive directors and 25% for all other staff, based  
on the achievement of increased profit, increased production, 
increased EBITDA, securing new business opportunities and  
ensuring that the Company remains well financed. Total payments  
of  1 14,022 to executive directors have been approved by the 
Remuneration Committee in respect of the performance for the  
year to 31 December 2012 (201 1: nil). 31
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Alkane Energy plc Governance
Recognising the continuing commitments and efforts being 
asked of staff in achieving the Company's challenging expansion 
programme, the Remuneration Committee has approved  
a bonus scheme for 2013 for all staff, including executive 
directors, based on the achievement of targets related to Group 
profit, output and production costs, securing new business 
opportunities and ensuring the Company remains well financed.
The maximum potential bonus payment available under the 
scheme is 50% of basic salary for executive directors and 25% 
for all other staff.
Bonuses are not pensionable.
Pensions and life assurance
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. 
Pension contributions for executive directors are based on salary 
only, with other discretionary benefits excluded. For the financial 
year under review, the Company contributed 10% of basic 
salary (2011: 10%). Non-executive directors are ineligible to 
join the Company's pension scheme.
Share options and long-term share incentives
(i) 2011 Employee Share Incentive Plan
The 2011 Employee Share Incentive Plan ( Plan') comprises 
(a) a Performance Share Plan (b) Employee Share Option Plan 
and (c) Sharesave Scheme. This Plan was designed to replace 
the previous schemes which are now closed with no further 
awards being granted. Non-executive directors are not 
eligible for participation in the Plan.
(a) Performance Share Plan( PSP')
The PSP is open to all employees including executive 
directors. The operation of the PSP is subject to ongoing 
review by the Committee with regards to the level of 
allocation and frequency of individual awards, conditional 
that the awards granted in any ten year period shall not 
exceed 10% of the nominal share capital.
The exercise of awards granted under the PSP is 
conditional upon the achievement of objective 
performance targets set at the time of grant.
During the year awards of 1,013,533 Ordinary Shares of 
0.5 pence were made to executive directors, exercisable 
on the vesting date of 31 March 2015 on the achievement 
of the following performance targets:
Up to 50% maximum on the increase in share price at 
vesting date from a base level of 22.5 pence.
Up to 50% maximum on the achievement of increased 
adjusted profit per share as at 31 December 2014 from 
the adjusted profit per share at 31 December 2011.
In respect of each criteria shares will be vested in 
proportion to the level of growth, with maximum 
vesting at a growth level of 25%.
(b) Employee Share Option Plan ( ESOP')
The Committee has the authority to grant options under 
the ESOP, either: 
Part A which has been formally approved by HMRC under 
schedule 4 to ITEPA; or 
Part B which will not receive any of the beneficial tax 
treatment available for options granted under Part A.
The ESOP is open to all employees, including full-time 
executive directors. For all options granted, the option price 
is determined by reference to the market value at the date of 
grant and all personnel are required to pay the full grant price 
on exercise.
Options granted under the ESOP are exercisable between 
three and ten years from the award, subject where 
appropriate to the achievement of an objective 
performance target set at the time of grant.
The operation of the ESOP is subject to ongoing review by 
the Committee in particular with respect to amendment or 
waiver of any grant targets provided the revised target is 
not materially more difficult to achieve than the original 
performance target.
(c) Sharesave Scheme 2011 ( Sharesave')
The scheme is open to all eligible employees, to provide a 
long term savings and investment opportunity for all staff. 
Executive directors are permitted to participate in the 
Sharesave Scheme, on equal eligibility terms as other 
employees, which allows participants to save between  5 and 
 250 per month, through payroll deductions for a period of 
three to five years after which they can acquire shares at a 
discount of up to 20% of the market value, set at the time  
of invitation.
Options over 104,046 Ordinary Shares were granted  
to executive directors during the year.
As is the case with all savings related schemes there are no 
performance criteria.
Further details of the executive directors' interests in share 
options and performance shares are set out on page 35.
(ii) Closed Incentive Plan 
The Company's Post Admission Share Option Scheme (the 
 Scheme') which has been in operation for executive directors 
and employees since 2001 was closed for new option awards 
in March 2011. However, options granted under the Scheme 
may continue to be exercised up to their latest exercise date. 
For all options granted, the option price is determined by 
reference to the market value at the date of grant and all 
personnel are required to pay the full grant price on exercise.
Options granted under the Scheme are exercisable between 
three and ten years from the award. The operation of the 
Scheme, with regards to the level of allocation and frequency 
of issue of options, was at the discretion of the Committee, 
taking into account the practice of comparable companies  
and the guidelines of the Association of Business Insurers. 
During the year no share options under the Scheme were 
exercised by executive directors (2011: nil).  32 To find out more details of our business go to: www.alkane.co.uk

2 John Lander resigned as non-executive Chairman on 31 October 2012.
Roger McDowell will offer himself for election and Cameron Davies will offer himself for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting.
Fees are determined by the Board based on independent advice and by comparison with fees paid by other companies of similar size 
and complexity, and reflect the amount of time non-executive directors are expected to devote to the Group's activities during the 
year. No additional fees are paid to non-executive directors who chair committees of the Board. Individual directors are not involved  
in any discussion concerning their own remuneration. There is no notice period in respect of non-executive directors' appointment,  
and no benefits are payable to them on termination of appointment.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, share incentives or any similar payments other than out-of-pocket expenses in 
connection with the performance of their duties.
Executive directors service contracts and notice periods
The executive directors have service contracts with the Company, which are not of fixed duration and which are terminable in each 
case by either party giving 12 months' written notice. The service contracts allow the Company to terminate the employment of an 
executive director without notice by making a payment in lieu of notice calculated to compensate the executive directors for salary and 
contractual benefits over the unexpired period of notice although the Company is not obliged to exercise its right to make a payment 
in lieu of notice. Copies of service contracts are available for inspection prior to and during the Annual General Meeting.
The details of the executive directors' individual service contracts are set out below:

Stephen Goalby will offer himself for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
External appointments
The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public appointments and 
believes the Group can benefit from such external appointments. Accordingly, subject to Board approval, executive directors may 
accept such appointments providing that this is not likely to lead to a conflict of interest with the Company's activities and that the 
wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual.
