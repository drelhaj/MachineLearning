Board report on remuneration
The remuneration committee (the Committee ) determines the remuneration of the executive Directors and makes recommendations
to the Board of any changes to the terms and conditions of employment of executive Directors. The Committee consists of four
independent non-executive Directors: Ken Clarke (Chairman), Neil Cross, Adrian Loader and Patrick Ponsolle. Jeff Harris and Stefano Pessina
attend meetings in advisory capacities but are not present when their own remuneration is discussed.
Remuneration policy
The aims of the Group's remuneration policy has been, and will continue to be, to maximise the position of the Group in the European
healthcare sector by attracting, retaining and motivating the highest calibre of executive Directors and senior executives and align the
rewards of those individuals with the interests of shareholders by linking part of their remuneration package to the performance of the
Group and the creation of long-term shareholder value.
In implementing the remuneration policy, the Committee has considered the principles in the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued by the UK Financial Services Authority, which applied to this period, with regard to Directors' remuneration.
In accordance with the remuneration policy, the remuneration of executive Directors is made up of a combination of basic salary,
annual performance bonus, non-cash benefits, long-term incentive plan benefits, share options and pension benefits, all of which 
are detailed below. The executive Directors' remuneration is reviewed at the start of each calendar year. 
Service contracts
Geoff Cooper, George Fairweather, Per Utnegaard and Steve Duncan are employed within the Group under contracts that can be
terminated by either party with notice of twelve months. Stefano Pessina and Ornella Barra have service contracts that can be
terminated by the Group with notice of twelve months or by each of them with notice of six months. There are provisions in the
service contracts for payment in lieu of current salary to cover the required notice period. Were the situation to arise, the Company
intends to apply the principle of mitigation to any payment of compensation on termination as a result of unsatisfactory performance.
The dates of the executive Directors' current service contracts are:
Director Contract date
S. Pessina 10 December 2002
G.I. Cooper 4 March 1994
G.R. Fairweather 28 March 2002
O. Barra 10 December 2002
P . Utnegaard 3 September 2003
S.W.J. Duncan 29 December 1995
The Company recognises that its executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive Directors of other listed companies and
that such duties can broaden experience and knowledge, which will benefit the Company. Executive Directors are therefore allowed
to accept one external non-executive appointment with the Company's prior approval as long as this is not in any way connected 
with the company's business and would not lead to any conflict of interest. Fees received by the Director may be retained. Jeff Harris
is a non-executive Director of Bunzl and retained fees for that appointment of  7,916 during the period he was executive Chairman
of Alliance UniChem Plc. He is also a Director of Andreae-Noris Zahn, a German company in which the Group has an interest, the fees
payable being retained by the Company. Stefano Pessina is a non-executive Director of Galenica, an associate company. He waived his
entitlement to a Director's fee as part of the agreement with Galenica on reciprocal board representation. Geoff Cooper was appointed 
a non-executive Director of Abbey National in January 2004 and will retain the fees payable. George Fairweather was appointed 
a non-executive Director of Mitchells & Butlers in April 2003 and retained fees paid of  33,986 in 2003 for that appointment. 
Salaries
The setting of basic salary reflects the Committee's assessment of the market rate for relevant positions, taking into account the levels
of responsibility, the individual Director's experience and his or her contribution to the business. For determining basic salary in 2003
and 2004, the Committee appointed and received advice from Monks Partnership. Monks Partnership does not provide any other
service to the Company. Where a Director is entitled to a benefit but chooses not to take that benefit, a supplement to the salary
is paid in lieu of that benefit. The amount paid to each Director in 2003 is detailed in the emoluments section below.
Benefits
Other benefits available to executive Directors relate to the provision of company cars or a car allowance, private medical insurance,
and, for Stefano Pessina, and in the case of Ornella Barra from September 2003, the cost of travel to and from work and accommodation
while working for the Group in the UK. The provision of these benefits reflects market practice and is not related to performance.
The value of these non-cash benefits for each Director in 2003, including expenses chargeable to UK income tax, are detailed in 
the emoluments section below. Alliance UniChem Plc 39
Annual performance bonuses
The annual performance bonus rewards executive Directors for the Group and individual divisions for which they are responsible
achieving their budgeted performance, after the cost of the bonuses. The payment also takes into account personal performance. 
In 2003, the budgeted performance was based on the challenging but achievable 2003 budget for earnings, before amortisation 
of intangible assets, at constant exchange rates, agreed by the Board at the beginning of the year. Depending upon responsibilities,
a bonus of between 5% and 15% was payable for performance of 100% of the Group and divisional performance, rising to 40% 
for performance of 105% of the Group and divisional budgeted performance.
Personal performance was based on a 360-degree appraisal process and determined by the remuneration committee. Depending 
on responsibilities, a bonus of up to 15% was payable based on this appraisal. 
The maximum bonus an executive Director could receive was 50% of their basic salary. The amount due to each Director in respect
of performance in 2003 is detailed in the emoluments section below.
Non-executive Directors
All non-executive Directors are entitled to a basic fee of  35,000. Jeff Harris retired as an executive in April 2003, continuing as Chairman
in a non-executive capacity under which he is entitled to a total fee of  250,000 per annum. In addition, in 2003 he received  15,000
of unfunded pension payments directly from the Company, further details of which are set out in the pensions section of this report.
Ken Clarke is the Deputy Chairman and senior independent non-executive Director and receives a total fee of  125,000 per annum,
which includes a fee of  5,000 per annum for chairing the remuneration committee. Neil Cross receives a total fee of  45,000, which
includes a fee of  10,000 per annum for chairing and serving on the audit committee. Other members of the audit committee are
each paid an additional fee of  5,000 per annum. The fees paid reflect the time non-executive Directors are required to commit to
their duties and amounts paid to non-executives in comparable companies. The UK Board Index of the 150 largest quoted companies
by market value published by Spencer Stuart was used to assess comparability. The Board reviews these fees periodically and no
Director is permitted to vote in respect of their own remuneration.
Non-executive Directors derive no other benefits from their office and are not eligible to participate in the Group's pension arrangements.
Jeff Harris receives a pension in respect of his service whilst acting as an executive of the Company. It is Company policy not to grant
share options to non-executive Directors or to require part of their fees to be paid in the form of shares. Jeff Harris will continue to
be eligible to receive share options in connection with allocations made under the long-term incentive plan whilst he was an executive
Director. In the case of the award arising from the 2000 allocation he has a year in which to exercise his option. In the case of any
award arising from the 2001 allocation he will be entitled to 50% of the award and will have six months to exercise the award and
in the case of any award arising from the 2002 allocation he will be entitled to 25% of the award and will have six months to 
exercise the award.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for fixed terms, normally of three years. Non-executive Directors who have served beyond six
years are subject to a more rigorous review when they come up for re-election. This review takes account of the need for progressive
refreshing of the Board. The initial appointment dates and next date of election/re-election for the current non-executive Directors
are as follows:

Long-term incentive plan
The long-term incentive plan is a discretionary arrangement under which allocations are made to executive Directors with the aim of
rewarding them for creating shareholder value. Each allocation takes the form of a non-binding statement of intent to make an award
of a stated maximum amount following the end of a specified performance period. The allocation is determined as a percentage of
basic salary in the year the performance period starts. The Directors' allocations outstanding at 24 February 2004 are:
2001 allocation 2002 allocation 2003 allocation 2004 allocation
maximum amount maximum amount maximum amount maximum amount

Period end 31 December 2003 31 December 2004 31 December 2005 31 December 2006
The amount of the award is dependent on the achievement of certain performance measures during the performance period that the
Committee believe are the most appropriate measure of the underlying performance of the Group. Total shareholder return measures
the total return to shareholders in terms of share price growth and dividends reinvested in the shares of the Company over the performance
period. Inbucon Group provides the Committee with a total shareholder return monitoring report and advises on performance under
the long-term incentive plan based on diluted earnings per share performance. Earnings per share are defined as the diluted earnings
per share before amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items as reported for a full accounting year. RPI-x is the index of
retail prices for all items excluding mortgage payments as published by the UK Government. The performance against RPI-x is
calculated on a per annum compound basis.
For the 2001 and 2002 allocation, the total shareholder return measure is compared with the performance of companies in the FTSE 250.
Performance measure Achievement % awarded
Total shareholder return below median -
at median (50%) 12.5%
for every 1% above median +1.5%
up to upper quartile (75%) 50.0%
Earnings per share below RPI-x +3% -
at RPI-x +3% 5.0%
for every 0.1% above RPI-x +3% +4.5%
up to RPI-x +4% 50.0%
For the 2003 and 2004 allocations, the total shareholder return measure is compared with the performance of companies in the
FTSE 100, and the earnings per share measure was changed to:
Performance measure Achievement % awarded
Earnings per share below RPI-x +5% -
at RPI-x +5% 5.0%
for every 0.1% above RPI-x +5% +4.5%
up to RPI-x +6% 50.0%
The award takes the form of a right to acquire ordinary shares in the Company for a nominal sum within a period of ten years from
the date of the award. The number of shares will be determined by the market price of the Company's shares at the date of the award. 
The Committee has the discretion to withhold or reduce awards to any extent it considers appropriate, having regard to the Group's
underlying financial performance and irrespective of the level of attainment of the performance targets.
During 2003, awards were made on allocations with the performance period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2002. During the
performance period, the Company was in the 86th percentile of the comparator group on total shareholder return and the increase in
earnings per share was in excess of RPI-x +4%. On this basis, awards equivalent to 100% of the allocations were made and converted
into share options at 467 pence per share, as follows:
Allocation Award nominal value Award share options

Board report on remuneration (continued)
The awards are further detailed in the table of interests in share option schemes below.
Following the end of the performance period for the 2001 allocation detailed above, the Committee has recommended to the trustees
of the 1992 Employee Trust that awards equivalent to 82% of the allocation are made. Their basis for doing this is that during the
performance period, the Company was in the 63rd percentile of the comparator group on shareholder return and the increase in
earnings per share was in excess of RPI-x +4%.

Stefano Pessina has no pension benefits. Per Utnegaard is eligible to join the Company's pension scheme with effect from 1 January 2004.
The accrued pension is a benefit of the defined benefit plan of the Company's pension scheme. The arrangements of the pension scheme
are as follows: the normal retirement age of the Directors is 60; Jeff Harris received an unreduced pension from age 55, based on
arrangements entered into with the Company in 1992. The pension arising was agreed to be calculated on the basis of the annual 
rate of basic salary at the time of retirement plus the annual average of car/fuel benefit and bonus over the three years preceding
retirement.  14,000 of this pension is unfunded and paid directly by the Company, and the cost for this is reported in the emoluments
disclosure. The above figures take account of this unfunded pension liability. All current executive Directors' pension benefits are
calculated excluding bonuses. Directors are required to pay a contribution of 5% of basic salary; a spouse's pension of one half of 
the Director's pension is payable on death after retirement; a statutory minimum pension for the legal widow and the Director's
accumulated contributions are payable on death after leaving service but before retirement; Directors' pensions are automatically
increased each year after retirement in line with inflation; additional increases may be payable at the discretion of the Trustee of 
the scheme, subject to the approval of the Company; no allowance is made for discretionary benefits within transfer values.
The Company pays the additional money purchase contributions into separate schemes with no additional contributions from the Directors.
Any additional voluntary contributions paid by the Directors, and the benefits arising from such contributions, are excluded from
the table. 44 Alliance UniChem Plc

The aggregate gains before tax made by the Directors on the exercise of share options was  792,308 (2002  311,731).
There were no changes to the options of the Directors above between 1 January 2004 and 24 February 2004.  Alliance UniChem Plc 45
The mid-market price of shares of the Company ranged during 2003 between 555.0 pence on 15 October and 375.0 pence 
on 12 March and at 31 December was 519.0 pence.
No further awards will be made under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1990. 
The options granted under the 1997 Share Option Scheme are exercisable only if, at any time during the exercise period, earnings per
share growth of the Company in the period from the grant of the option was greater than the increase in RPI-x plus 4% compound.
Earnings per share are defined as the diluted earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items as
reported for a full accounting year. RPI-x is the index of retail prices for all items excluding mortgage payments as published by the 
UK Government. The performance criteria in respect of options with an exercise price of  2.6850,  4.2950,  4.3500 and  3.7900
have been passed.
The options granted to Ornella Barra under the 1997 Share Option Scheme with an exercise price of  4.2950 and  4.3500 formed
part of the arrangements of the merger with Alliance Sant  S.A..
