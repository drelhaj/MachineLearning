Directors' Remuneration Report
for the year ended 31 October 2010
This report sets out the information required by the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The Report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions relating to directors' 
remuneration in the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance. As required by the Regulations, the Directors' Remuneration Report 
will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting on 24 March 2011.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on certain parts of the Directors' Remuneration Report and to 
state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. 
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for the audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee comprised:
Mr I F R Much (Committee Chairman)
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman
Mr P C F Hickson (appointed 1 July 2010) 
The Committee's principal responsibilities are:
  determining, agreeing with the Board and reviewing from time to time the overall policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, 
the executive directors, the Company Secretary and certain other senior executives in the Group, and their individual remuneration 
packages and any changes thereto;
  reviewing the market competitiveness of the remuneration policy and arrangements;
  overseeing salary levels and remuneration packages for the second and third tiers of management;
  approving the terms and conditions of employment, and any changes thereto, of the executive directors; 
  approving any compensation payments for executive directors;
  approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group;
  reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and the Company's shareholders; 
  providing oversight of potential remuneration-related risks arising across the Group; and
  overseeing any major changes in employee benefits structures across the Group. 
With the exception of Mr Hickson whose remuneration is determined by the Committee, none of the Committee members has 
any personal financial interest in the matters reserved for the Committee nor do they have any conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships, and they are not involved in the day to day running of the Group's business. Therefore, they are regarded by 
the Board as independent. Mr Hickson does not participate in any discussions regarding his own remuneration.
The Committee met six times during the year. The Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation but is not present during any discussions 
relating to his own remuneration. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company's website or on request from the Company Secretary.
Advisers
During the year the Committee received advice on remuneration and incentive plan related matters from Hewitt New Bridge Street. 
The Company received no other services from Hewitt New Bridge Street or any other part of Hewitt Associates during the year. The Committee 
also received advice from Odgers Berndtson on the remuneration package for the new Chairman during the recruitment process. 
The Committee consults internally with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The Committee's policy is to provide executive remuneration packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by reference to market 
rates across comparator companies, reflect the performance of the business against financial objectives, and which take into account the 
individual contribution and performance of each executive director. Remuneration packages comprise the following elements:
(i) base salary and benefits, including pensions;
(ii) annual bonuses linked to the Group's financial performance and personal objectives; and 
(iii) awards of share-based incentives linked to the long term growth of the Group.
The Committee aims to align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders, by ensuring that a significant proportion 
of remuneration is performance-related. This is achieved through the performance-related elements of annual bonuses and 
share-based incentives. Corporate governance

Key aspects of the remuneration arrangements for the executive directors and changes thereto during the year are summarised below. 
Base salary: The Committee had been aware, for some time, that the salaries of the executive directors had not reflected the substantial 
growth in the Group's revenue, earnings, dividends and market capitalisation in recent years. It had delayed addressing this anomaly 
during the initial stages of the economic downturn. In early 2010, however, following a year of 33% growth in underlying earnings per 
share, it was evident that the Group was in a position to continue its strong growth in revenue and earnings. The Committee therefore 
decided to review the executive directors' salaries in the context of the outstanding Group performance and the need to maintain market 
competitive salary levels. The Committee also took into account retention issues and the demand for talented executive management with 
a proven track record in the industry. Against this background, base salaries for the executive directors were increased by just over 14% 
with effect from 1 April 2010. 
Pension provision: The Committee agreed that with effect from 6 April 2010, the executive directors would cease to participate in the 
Group's defined benefit pension scheme, and would instead, for all future service, receive a salary supplement of 20% of base salary. 
Whilst these levels of contributions have enhanced the short term fixed costs to the Company relative to the existing defined benefit 
pension arrangements, there is clearly an advantageous and offsetting transfer of investment risk to the individuals. 
As a result of these two changes, the overall level of fixed pay for the executive directors was aligned more closely with the median of 
the market benchmarks used by the Committee (benchmarks which take into account both market capitalisation and turnover, and which 
have therefore increased less for the Group than would have arisen if based solely on market capitalisation). 
Annual bonus: Executive directors are now required to receive 40% of any bonus earned in the form of deferred shares (an increase 
from 25% in 2009). All other key aspects of the bonus scheme remain unchanged, save that in accordance with emerging good practice, 
clawback provisions have now been introduced into the bonus scheme, which will enable the Company to clawback deferred shares prior 
to vesting in the event of subsequent discovery of material misstatement of the Company's financial results for the financial year in 
respect of which the deferred shares were awarded.
Share awards: Following approval by the Group's shareholders of the increase in maximum award levels permissible under the Group's 
performance share plan at the March 2010 Annual General Meeting, share awards worth (at grant) up to 125% of base salary were granted 
to the executive directors during the year. In accordance with current market norms, and as anticipated at the time of seeking approval 
for the increased award levels, the normal annual award limit will increase to 150% of base salary for the executive directors from 2011 
onwards. The Committee wishes to ensure that the executive directors are appropriately rewarded for exceptional performance and 
accordingly, the higher award levels will be subject to even more challenging earnings per share growth targets than those which were 
applied to the 125% awards made in 2010. Further details are set out below.
Comparator groups
The constituents of the sector-based comparator group utilised by the Committee for remuneration benchmarking purposes during the 
year were as follows:
Charter International plc Melrose PLC Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc
Chloride Group PLC QinetiQ Group PLC Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Halma p.l.c. Rotork PLC VT Group plc 
IMI plc Spectris plc The Weir Group PLC
Meggitt PLC  
The Committee also considered general comparator groups based on FTSE250 companies with a similar market capitalisation and turnover. 
Base salaries and benefits
The executive directors' base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if appropriate, taking into account 
individual performance and comparable salary levels in the comparator groups set out above. The Committee refers to published salary 
surveys and data provided by its remuneration advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, and also reviews the remuneration information 
presented in the annual reports of companies in the comparator groups. 
The executive directors' current base salaries are as follows:
  Dr D J Price  480,000 (2009:  420,000)
  Mr P A Rayner  300,000 (2009:  262,500)
The executive directors' base salaries will next be reviewed on 1 April 2011.
The Committee also considers and approves the base salaries for twenty two other senior executives, and reviews salaries for the next 
two tiers of management at each of the Group's businesses. In addition, the Committee receives information on general pay levels across 
the Group. The Committee therefore has due regard to salary levels across the Group in applying its remuneration policy.
The main taxable benefits for executive directors are fully-expensed company cars and private medical insurance.

Annual bonuses
During the year under review, the Company operated an annual performance-related bonus plan for the executive directors, with key 
characteristics as follows:
  a maximum bonus potential for the executive directors of 100% of base salary;
  three quarters of the bonus potential linked to two separate financial performance conditions, namely earnings per share and cash flow 
(with equal weighting). The conditions, which are set by the Committee, take into account a number of factors including budget, market 
expectations, long term growth prospects and the previous year's out-turn. No bonus is payable for achievement of less than 90% of 
target, with bonuses being earned thereafter on a straight-line basis up to the maximum for 110% or better achievement of target;
  one quarter of the bonus potential may be achieved in connection with the satisfaction of personal objective criteria set at the 
beginning of the financial year. These comprise a mixture of short term and longer term objectives linked to the delivery of the 
Company's strategic plan. No part of this element of bonus is payable unless threshold performance of both the financial conditions 
described above is achieved. The personal objectives set for the executive directors during the year were linked to the following 
strategic objectives:
 - delivery of improvements in the Group's health, safety and environmental performance
 - growth of the Group's order book, and development of key strategic growth opportunities
 - implementation of the expansion plans for the International Division
 - development of key new products and successful competitive strategies
 - completion of new production facilities
 - improved phasing of cashflow generation and management of working capital;
  40% of any bonus payable is deferred as a conditional award of the Company's shares, with vesting subject to continued employment 
(save in good leaver scenarios) three years from the award of bonus; and 
  the payment of any bonus remains ultimately at the discretion of the Committee.
Bonuses are non-pensionable.
The table below summarises the bonuses earned by the executive directors, as a percentage of base salary, in respect of the current and 
last years (the figures in brackets are the maximum percentages that could have been achieved:
2010 2009
Bonus percentage received for: D J Price P A Rayner D J Price P A Rayner
Earnings per share performance 17.78  (37.5) 17.78  (37.5) 35.63  (37.5) 35.63  (37.5)
Cash flow performance 24.03 (37.5) 24.03  (37.5) 37.5  (37.5) 37.5  (37.5)

Total 61.81  (100.0) 61.31  (100.0) 94.13  (100.0) 94.38  (100.0)
The Committee continues to set highly challenging bonus targets for the achievement of maximum bonuses. Despite the outstanding 
levels of EPS growth and returns to shareholders delivered by the Group in recent years, the executive directors have not received 
maximum bonuses in any of the last four years as evidenced by the chart below.

The basic structure of the bonus scheme will remain unchanged for the current financial year, namely with a maximum bonus potential of 
100% of base salary, with 40% of any bonus satisfied by the award of deferred shares. However, clawback provisions have now been 
introduced into the bonus scheme, which will enable the Company to clawback the deferred shares prior to vesting in the event of 
subsequent discovery of material misstatement of the Company's financial results for the financial year in respect of which the deferred 
shares were awarded. Bonuses will continue to be determined by a mixture of earnings per share, cash flow and personal objectives.  Corporate governance

Performance share plan
The Company operates the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan for the executive directors and other key members of the senior 
management team who influence the performance and prospects of the Group. The key features of the plan are currently as follows:
  conditional awards can be made of the Company's shares worth no more than 150% of base salary each year under normal 
circumstances;
  awards will vest three years after grant subject to the extent to which a demanding performance condition has been achieved over a single 
three year performance period (with no ability to re-test the performance condition). The performance condition is based on the growth 
of the Company's earnings per share in excess of RPI over three consecutive financial years. The Committee considers an earnings per 
share condition to most closely align the interests of participants with those of the Company's shareholders; 
  the vesting schedules for awards granted to date are as follows:
Total earnings per share growth per annum  
(not compounded) over three financial years
Threshold vesting Full vesting
Awards made prior to 23 January 2007 RPI +5% (33% vests) RPI+15%
Awards made on 24 January 2007 RPI +7.5% (33% vests) RPI+20%
Awards made on or after 23 January 2008 RPI +10% (25% vests) RPI+30%
Awards made on or after 20 January 2010
RPI + 10% (25% vests for awards 
up to 100% of base salary)
RPI + 25% (for any additional 
awards over 100% of base salary) 
RPI + 25% (for awards 
up to 100% of base salary)
RPI + 30% (for awards 
up to 125% of base salary)*
* For awards of up to 125% of base salary, 100% will vest at RPI + 25%, with the additional 25% vesting on a straight-line basis between RPI + 25% and RPI + 30%
  No shares vest for growth below the threshold vesting target. Vesting is calculated on a straight-line basis for growth between the 
threshold and full vesting targets;
  earnings per share is calculated on a fully diluted and normalised basis, as specified by the Committee prior to grant; and
  market purchase shares or new issue shares (including treasury shares) may be used to satisfy awards. To the extent that new issue 
shares or treasury shares are used, these will count towards the usual share usage dilution limits (10% in ten years for all schemes 
and 5% in ten years for discretionary (executive) schemes).
Participation in the plan is extended at the discretion of the Committee to the executive directors and senior management of the Group, 
both in the UK and overseas. The following awards were made under the plan during the year:
Date of award
Total number of  
shares awarded
Number of participants 
receiving awards
20 January 2010 105,693 31
18 March 2010 5,115 2
Total 110,808 33
Details of the awards made to executive directors during the year are set out on pages 38 and 39.
Clawback provisions will apply to all awards under the plan from 2011 onwards, which will enable the Company to clawback awards prior to 
vesting in the event of subsequent discovery of material misstatement of the Company's financial results, and after having first clawed back 
any unvested deferred shares awarded as part of the annual bonus for the financial year in which the results were misstated.
In considering the performance condition for awards which will be made in 2011, the Committee has acknowledged the continuing strong 
prospects for the Group, whilst recognising that defence budgets around the world may still come under pressure in the next few years. 
As a consequence, it is intended that the target for full vesting of awards worth up to 100% of salary will be maintained at RPI + 25%. 
Higher target growth of up to RPI + 35% will be required for full vesting of any award made above the 100% of base salary limit. This will 
continue the Committee's policy of setting highly challenging performance targets, which align the interests of shareholders and the 
executive management, whilst rewarding the management in the event of outstanding performance. The following vesting schedule will 
therefore apply for awards made in 2011: 
Total earnings per share growth per annum  
(not compounded) over three financial years Value of award that will vest
Less than RPI + 10% Nil
RPI + 10% 25% of base salary
RPI + 25% 100% of base salary
RPI + 25% up to RPI + 35% 100% to 150% of base salary Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2010

Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information
These targets remain among the most demanding performance criteria anywhere and reflect the Committee's ongoing commitment 
to setting appropriately challenging targets for executives to pursue. 
The Committee reviews, from time to time, the basis of the performance condition but continues to believe that the earnings per share 
metric mostly closely aligns the interests of executives and shareholders, and therefore remains an appropriate metric for the Group. 
During the year under review, the Company purchased 126,880 (2009: 78,301) treasury shares at a cost of  3.9 million for use in 
the plan. 100,011 shares were transferred from treasury to participants in the plan during the year on vesting of the awards made 
on 27 September 2006 and 24 January 2007. 
The executive directors are expected to build-up, over a five year period following appointment, and maintain a shareholding in the 
Company equivalent to one year's base salary. Both of the executive directors currently hold shares significantly in excess of this 
requirement. Other participants in the plan are expected to retain a shareholding equivalent to up to 50% of their base salary following 
vesting of the awards. 
Other schemes
The Company operates all-employee savings-related share schemes in the UK (the Chemring Group 2008 Sharesave Plan) and the USA 
(the Chemring Group 2008 US Stock Purchase Plan). There are no performance criteria for these arrangements, and options are issued 
to all participants in accordance with UK HM Revenue and Customs and US Internal Revenue Service regulations. 
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines contained within Executive Remuneration - ABI Guidelines on Policies and Practices . 
At 31 October 2010, awards outstanding and issued under all share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 2.98% of the 
ordinary share capital of the Company. At 31 October 2010, awards outstanding and issued under executive share schemes during the 
previous ten years amounted to 2.65% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.

The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends.
Pensions
Dr Price was a member of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme (the Staff Scheme ) until 6 April 2010. This is an approved final 
salary scheme, which is contracted out of the State Second Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up to two-thirds 
of salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits. The Staff Scheme also provides life assurance cover, dependants' pensions and lump sum 
payments on death-in-service. Members of the Staff Scheme are required to make monthly contributions to the scheme at the rate of 8% 
of pensionable salary.
Dr Price's pension under the Staff Scheme accrued at 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of membership, and he also accrued a 
cash lump sum at 3/80ths of final pensionable salary for each year of membership. Dr Price was subject to an earnings cap (equivalent to 
the cap applied by HM Revenue and Customs prior to April 2006) in respect of his membership of the Staff Scheme.
Mr Rayner was also a member of the Staff Scheme until 6 April 2010. Mr Rayner's benefits under the Staff Scheme accrued in an identical 
manner to that in which Dr Price accrued benefits, as set out above, save that Mr Rayner was not contracted out of the State Second Pension. 
Mr Rayner was also subject to an earnings cap. 
Both Dr Price and Mr Rayner have a normal retirement age of 65. Corporate governance

Directors' Remuneration Report
continued
The Committee has previously referred to the fact that the pension arrangements for the executive directors under the Staff Scheme 
(1/80ths accrual rate only as far as the notional earnings cap) were well below market norms, and as explained above, in recent years 
this was a contributory factor in the relatively low level of their overall fixed pay. The Committee therefore agreed that with effect from 
6 April 2010, the executive directors would cease to participate in the Staff Scheme, and would instead, for all future service, receive a 
salary supplement of 20% of base salary. 
Service contracts
Dr Price has a rolling service contract dated 4 April 2005. This provides for termination by either party on twelve months' notice. 
The Company may however terminate without notice, and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of the salary due for 
the unexpired notice period plus the fair value of any contractual benefits. Any such sum may be paid in instalments, and in these 
circumstances there is a requirement to mitigate loss.
Mr Rayner has a rolling service contract dated 27 August 1999. This provides for termination by either party on twelve months' notice. 
The Company may however terminate without notice and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of twelve months' salary plus 
the value of any contractual benefits. There are no other provisions relating to compensation on early termination.
It is the Committee's general policy that all new executive directors appointed in the future will have service contracts with the Company 
which are terminable on a maximum of twelve months' notice. The service contracts will contain provisions permitting the Company to 
make any termination payments by instalments, and will require directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
Policy on outside appointments
With the specific approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of 
other companies, provided that they do not detract from their responsibilities to the Group, and may retain any related fees paid to them. 
Neither of the executive directors currently holds any such external appointments.
Non-executive directors
Mr Hickson was appointed as a non-executive director on 1 July 2010, and as Chairman on 1 October 2010. This followed an extensive 
and full external search by the Nomination Committee, chaired by the Senior Independent Director. Mr Hickson's letter of appointment 
provides for a three year appointment at a fixed fee of  170,000 per annum. The appointment may be terminated on six months' notice 
by either party. It is anticipated that Mr Hickson will devote four to five days each month to his role, subject to the overriding requirement 
that he allocates sufficient time to the role as is reasonably necessary for the proper performance of his duties. Ahead of Mr Hickson's 
appointment as Chairman, both the Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee reviewed fee levels for Chairmen in 
comparable companies and consulted with advisers on the appropriate level of fees for the role. 
Mr Scobie had a service contract with the Company which expired at the conclusion of the Company's Annual General Meeting in March 2010. 
Whilst the Company undertook a search for his successor, his contract was extended on a rolling basis. Mr Scobie's remuneration under 
the contract, part of which was paid to his company for consultancy services, was  145,000 per annum. Following his retirement as 
Chairman, the Board approved a payment of  50,000 to Mr Scobie, partly to reflect the fact that the Company did not make a payment in lieu 
of notice under Mr Scobie's contract but principally in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the Group during his thirteen year tenure.
The other non-executive directors are all appointed for three year terms under letters of appointment covering, amongst other items, 
their terms of appointment and expected time commitment. The appointments may be terminated earlier by and at the discretion 
of either party upon three months' written notice. The Rt Hon Lord Freeman is currently serving his second three year term as a 
non-executive director, which will expire on 25 May 2012. Mr Evans' current three year appointment as a non-executive director will 
terminate on 30 March 2012. Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss have both now served two three year terms, which expired on 
30 November 2010 and 30 April 2010 respectively. Their appointments were extended on a rolling basis pending the appointment of 
the new Chairman, to ensure a smooth transition. They will be reviewed during the forthcoming year.
The basic fee payable to each of the four non-executive directors is  44,000 per annum. The Rt Hon Lord Freeman and Mr Much each 
receive an additional fee of  8,000 per annum, in respect of their Chairmanship of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee 
respectively. Mr Much also serves as the Senior Independent Director but he receives no additional fee for this role.
Fees for the non-executive directors are determined annually by the Board, having regard to the practice of other companies and the 
particular demands of the Group.
The Company provides private medical insurance for Mr Evans, Mr Hickson and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, and their respective spouses.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's pension, bonus or share-based incentive schemes. However, Mr Evans does 
receive a pension from the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme, which he accrued during his former employment with the Company.  Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2010
