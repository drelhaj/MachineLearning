 Remuneration Committee report
www.berkeleygroup.co.uk 25
Introduction
On 25 June 2004 the Company announced that it had concluded a strategic review which led to the restructuring of the
Company that was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 17 September 2004. It was recognised at the time of the
strategic review that if the restructuring went ahead it would have a significant impact on the Company's existing
performance based compensation; in particular:
  the subsisting share awards and options under the Company's various share schemes;
  the annual bonus performance conditions for FY2005 and subsequent financial years; and
  the structure of the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the proposed performance conditions for the first grant of awards
under the Plan.
In light of the impact on a crucial part of the total remuneration package received by Executive Directors, the Remuneration
Committee felt that it was appropriate to revisit the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the EGM on
24 February 2004. Therefore, as part of the process leading up to the EGM on 17 September 2004, the Remuneration
Committee Chairman and the Committee's retained consultants, Halliwell Consulting, consulted with the Company's
principal shareholders on a revised remuneration policy. 
Following the extensive consultation, 77% of shareholders voting approved a new remuneration policy for the Company's
Executive Directors at the EGM held on 17 September 2004. The key features of the new remuneration policy are:
  the retention of the current salary freeze for the Executive Directors to 30 April 2006;
  a change to the performance conditions for the annual bonus plan; and
  the introduction of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan, The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) Long-Term Incentive Plan
(the 2004(b) LTIP ).
The Remuneration Committee believes that its revised policy and the new structure with an even stronger emphasis on
performance based short and long-term compensation should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business
strategy thereby enhancing shareholder value as well as providing meaningful incentives to Executives. This Report will be
put to an advisory vote of the Company's shareholders at the 2005 AGM on 1 September 2005. 
Background
This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, (the
regulations ). The auditors are required to report on the  auditable' part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion,
that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the
regulations). The report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
The Board has reviewed the Group's compliance with the Combined Code (the Code ) on remuneration related matters.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code throughout the year.

Remuneration Committee report continued
Remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises Mrs Victoria Mitchell (Chairman), Mr David Howell and Mr Tony
Palmer all of whom are Non-Executive Directors and independent. The Remuneration Committee members have no
personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising
from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role described.
A copy of the terms of reference can be downloaded from the Company's website. During the year in question the
Remuneration Committee formally met three times, with the sub-committee dealing with the design and introduction of the
2004(b) LTIP holding approximately 34 meetings with other members of the Board and the Company's major shareholders
during the year. 
The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year and continues to be advised by Halliwell Consulting, an
independent executive compensation and share scheme consultancy. No other services were provided to the Company
by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
In determining the Executive Directors' remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the
Group Chairman, Mr R St J H Lewis, the Group Managing Director, Mr A W Pidgley and the Group Finance Director,
Mr R C Perrins. No Director played a part in any discussion about his remuneration.
The Executive Directors hold no external appointments.
Remuneration policy overview
The objective of the remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives. The Remuneration
Committee believes that shareholders' interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on
performance-related pay. Emphasis on performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the new business
strategy. It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the policy provides meaningful incentives to Executives and
ensures that the appropriate balance between fixed and performance-related compensation is maintained. The policy, which
was agreed by shareholders at the EGM on 24 February 2004 and in its revised form on 17 September 2004, was to set
the main elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration package against the following quartiles in the Company's
comparator group:
For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Remuneration Committee uses the following comparator group
of companies:
Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in kind Share incentives
Upper decile Upper decile Lower quartile to median Market practice Upper quartile to upper decile

The Remuneration Committee reviews the policy on an annual basis to ensure that it is in line with the Company's 
objectives and shareholders' interests. 
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance based pay for each Executive Director
for the year ended 30 April 2005:
The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described below. 
Elements of Executive Directors' remuneration
Basic salary
Policy: Upper decile - Salary freeze 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2006
Year Ended 30 April 2005
In accordance with the salary freeze no rises were made during the year. 
Policy
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that the salaries of the Executive Directors should be set at the upper decile
in line with the Committee's view that the Company has one of the most experienced Executive teams within the sector.
The salary freeze will remain in place for the Executive team until 30 April 2006. The next salary review date will in the
normal course of events be 1 May 2006. It should be noted that in line with the Company's policy on salary reviews, the
reviews on 1 May 2006 will not result in automatic salary increases. It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to look
to the bonus and share arrangements to reward Executives for their performance rather than to increases in base salary.
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to increase salary levels if Executives are promoted or on the
occurrence of any unforeseen event which materially affects the Company and/or the market in which it operates. In the
event of such an unforeseen event the Remuneration Committee will consult shareholders before adjusting salary levels.
When determining the salaries of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration:
  the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly
similar size and complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group;
  the performance of the individual Executive Director; 
  the individual Executive Director's experience and responsibilities; and
  the pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Annual performance related bonus
Policy: Upper decile bonus potential
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to set the maximum annual bonus potential at the upper decile in relation
to the comparator group.
Over the first half of FY2005 the performance conditions for the Executive's annual bonus plan were as set out in the 2004
Remuneration Committee Report. The performance conditions for the second half of FY2005 were amended to take into
account the approval of the corporate reconstruction and the associated change of strategy for the Company. These
amended performance conditions were discussed and agreed with shareholders during the consultation process.

Remuneration Committee report continued
General
The theoretical maximum bonus available is 300% of salary. However, the Remuneration Committee will only in very
exceptional circumstances, outside the normal operation of the bonus plan for the year in question consider a bonus
payment greater than 200% of salary. On the occurrence of very exceptional circumstances and prior to any commitment
to make a bonus payment, the Remuneration Committee would consult shareholders to obtain their agreement that the
circumstances gave rise to the level of bonus payment proposed. Therefore, the effective maximum annual bonus potential
is 200% of salary.
Bonus targets are reviewed each year and agreed by the Remuneration Committee. The performance measures for the
Executive Directors' bonus plan are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the
current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging. 
The structure of bonus payments is as follows:
Participants in the annual bonus plan will only be eligible to receive a bonus if they meet the performance targets. However,
the Remuneration Committee will retain the discretion to adjust bonus payments (either up or down) if in their opinion the
results would otherwise be inappropriate. It should be noted that this discretion will be exercised sparingly to ensure
certainty for participants and transparency for shareholders. If the Remuneration Committee does exercise its discretion to
adjust bonus payments it will only do so where there is an objective justification which can be explained to shareholders. 
In addition, the Remuneration Committee will ensure that any changes to the basis of payment or financial performance
targets are independently verified. On an ongoing basis, the Remuneration Committee will continue to set robust and
challenging performance targets at the beginning of each financial year taking into account the business plan for that year
and general market conditions. 
Bonus payments are not pensionable.

The targets for the year ended 30 April 2005, their level of achievement and the corresponding bonus earned for the
Executive Directors are set out in the following tables:

The following formula sets out the Company's methodology for calculating ROCE for the annual bonus plan:
ROCE % = 
{
Earnings before Interest, Tax and Goodwill Amortisation
}
x 100
Average Shareholders' Funds + Average Net Debt
(i) Average Shareholders' Funds calculated by taking the Opening Balance Sheet Net Assets from the Group's Accounts for
the relevant Financial Year and the Closing Balance Sheet Net Assets from the Group's Accounts for the relevant Financial
Year and dividing by 2.
(ii) Average Net Debt calculated by taking the Opening Net Debt from the Group's Accounts for the relevant Financial Year
and the Closing Net Debt from the Group's Accounts for the relevant Financial Year and dividing by 2, and where the Group
is cash positive, such cash is excluded from the calculation.
Future policy
Prior to the reconstruction, the Remuneration Committee felt that ROCE was an appropriate measure for the Group
Executive Directors' Annual Performance Related Bonus Plan as this measure ensures that Executives are focused on
maintaining earnings whilst having the additional benefit of measuring the efficiency with which capital is being used to
generate those earnings. For Divisional Executive Directors 75% of the bonus potential was based on the satisfaction of
Divisional profit targets as the Remuneration Committee felt that it was important that the Divisional Executive Directors had
a strong focus on the performance of the Divisions which they run. However, the redemption payments under the new
strategy would have a distorting effect on Group ROCE and make it difficult for shareholders to compare the Company's
performance with other companies. Therefore, in line with the approach agreed with the Company's shareholders, going
forward the Group ROCE element of the bonus will be replaced with targets linked to the return of capital to shareholders.
It is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee that the element of bonus targets based on the return of capital to
shareholders for future bonus years will be as follows:
For years ending 30 April 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011, this element of the annual bonus will be subject to the returns of
capital of  5,  2,  2 and  3 per unit respectively.

Remuneration Committee report continued
For years ending 30 April 2006, 2008 and 2010, this element of bonus will be earned if the dividend lock up tests
3
are
satisfied at the end of the relevant financial year (six months earlier than required). If these tests are satisfied it means that
the Company is on target to be able to make the redemption payments on the due dates. If the dividend lock up tests are
not achieved at the end of the relevant financial year but the Board is of the view that they will be satisfied in time to make
the next redemption payment on the relevant date, this element of the bonus will be accrued and not declared until the
redemption payment has been made. In the highly unlikely event that a bonus is paid but the due redemption payment is
not made the share element of the bonus paid shall be forfeited and the cash element paid shall be offset against future
bonus entitlements.
The following table sets out the maximum bonus potential for the year ending 30 April 2006 and the performance targets
which will apply:
The maximum bonus potential for the year ended 30 April 2006 has not increased.
Share incentives
Policy: Upper quartile to upper decile
Overview
At the EGM on the 17 September 2004 shareholders approved the Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) Long-Term
Incentive Plan. This Plan was designed to support the Company's new strategy and replace the Berkeley Group plc 2004
Long-Term Incentive Plan (approved by shareholders at the EGM on 24 February 2004). The shareholding requirement
introduced remains in place. The shareholding requirements are:
* Based on shareholding at the date of publication of the Annual Report.
The only share awards made to Executive Directors during the year ended 30 April 2005 were under the Berkeley Group
Holdings plc 2004(b) Long-Term Incentive Plan.

No awards were granted under this Plan -
The Berkeley Group
plc 2000 Long-Term
Incentive Plan
The following grants had not vested at the time of the
reconstruction:
  2002; and
  2003.
The Court approval of the corporate reconstruction on
30 October 2004 meant that a Section 425
4
event
occurred. In accordance with the rules of the Plan this
resulted in the immediate vesting of the 2002 and 2003
awards subject to the proportionate satisfaction of the
performance conditions. In accordance with the rules
of the Plan the Remuneration Committee measured the
cumulative profit and net asset growth performance of
the Company for the 2002 award for the years ended
30 April 2003 and 30 April 2004 and for the 2003
Award for the year ended 30 April 2004 and found that
the performance conditions relating to those awards
had been satisfied in full and as such that the full value
of awards would vest.
However, to demonstrate their commitment to
the Company and shareholders the Executive
Directors have voluntarily agreed to defer the
receipt of benefits from the 2002 and 2003
awards until their original release dates. The
cessation of employment provisions in the rules
of the Plan will continue to apply. 
Share elements of awards have been converted
into awards over Units. Executive Directors will be
entitled to the receipt of redemption payments
on the Units subject to their awards over the
holding period.
No further performance conditions will apply to
these awards as the original conditions were
satisfied at the date of the Court approval in
accordance with the rules of the Plan.
The Berkeley Group
plc 2000 Share Option
Plan and the 2000
Approved Share
Option Plan 
The Court approval of the corporate reconstruction on
30 October 2004 meant that a Section 425 event
occurred. In accordance with the rules of the Plans this
resulted in the immediate vesting of options without
reference to the satisfaction of performance conditions
unless the Remuneration Committee determined
otherwise. In this case the Remuneration Committee
determined to offer all employees with options not
granted under the Approved Plan the opportunity
of either:
  exchanging options for options over Units of the
Company after the reconstruction; or
  the release of their options in consideration for
a conditional compensation payment. The
compensation payment was equal to the difference
between the average price of a share of the
Company over the ten business days prior to the
reconstruction becoming effective and the exercise
price of the relevant option multiplied by the number
of shares under such option. The cash payment will
only be provided if the participant is an employee of
the Company at the original vesting date for the
relevant option. The cessation of employment
provisions in the rules will continue to apply.
Approved Options could not be rolled-over into options
over Units as the Units did not qualify under the
relevant legislation. Therefore, the Remuneration
Committee, in accordance with the rules of the Plan,
determined that these options vested and became
exercisable on the Court approval for a period of six
months from 26 October 2004.
The only Executive Director to have unvested
options under these Plans was the Group
Managing Director. The Group Managing Director
exercised his approved options and chose the
conditional compensation payment in respect of
his unapproved options.
No further performance conditions will apply to
conditional compensation payments or options
for Executive Directors.
The Berkeley Group
plc 1994 SAYE Share
Option Scheme
In accordance with the rules of the Scheme options
held by all employees became exercisable on the 
Court approval of the corporate reconstruction on
26 October 2004 for a period of six months.
Executive Directors were treated in the same
manner as all employees of the Company.

Remuneration Committee report continued
The tables in the audited section of this Report provide full details of the actual awards released, options vested and the
conditional compensation payments and the terms applying to them. 
The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
No awards were granted under this Plan during the year.
Individuals were granted awards annually, the vesting of which were subject to the attainment of pre-determined
performance targets measured over a three year period. Awards were structured to deliver a pre-determined cash value and
a number of shares, each worth at the outset 50% of the value of the total annual award. The shares element was fixed by
reference to the market value of the Company's shares at the date of grant. The maximum value that could be delivered
under an award (based on the share price at the date of grant) was 200% of an individual's annual salary (excluding
bonuses and all other benefits) as at the date of grant. 
The cash element was payable following the third anniversary of the date of grant of the award provided the performance
targets had been met. The participant was only entitled to the share element following the fourth anniversary from the date
of grant of the award, by which time the outstanding value of the underlying shares had increased or decreased in line with
the Company's share price performance over the period since the date of grant. Performance under the LTIP was measured
according to the level of audited cumulative pre-tax profits of the division or Group company in which the participant was
employed over the relevant period. Achievement was determined on an all or nothing  basis over a period of three years
with no opportunity for re-testing. For awards under the LTIP to vest, the audited net assets of each division or Group
Company, after taking account of changes in share capital and dividend distributions, must also have increased by at least
a cumulative rate of 10% per annum since the base year.
These performance conditions were selected because it was the Board's view that profit and asset growth would ensure the
delivery of enhanced value to the Company's shareholders.
The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Approved & Unapproved Executive Share Option Plans (the Option Plans )
No grants of options have been made to Executive Directors under the Option Plans during the year.
Two executive option plans were introduced in 2000. Under the option plans individuals were eligible to be granted options
annually over shares worth up to 100% of annual salary (excluding bonuses and all other benefits). The Remuneration
Committee had the discretion to vary this amount in exceptional circumstances, in which case the limit was 200% of
annual salary (excluding bonuses and all other benefits). Exercise of options granted was conditional upon meeting
defined performance targets based on the increase in earnings per ordinary share over a three year period.
New long-term share incentive arrangements for the Executive Directors
The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2004(b) LTIP )
The 2004(b) LTIP is the Company's sole long-term share incentive arrangement for the Executive Directors and was
approved by shareholders at the EGM on 17 September 2004 with 77% of shareholders voting supporting the Plan.
Prior to the EGM, the Company conducted a full consultation with major shareholders and institutional shareholder bodies. 
The Plan provides the Executive Directors, excluding the Executive Chairman, with rights to receive, at no cost, such
number of shares as results in them holding 15% of the equity of the Company following the issue of those rights.
The shares will only be released to the Executive Directors if the Company has returned to shareholders  12 per share
by 31 January 2011. 50% of released shares are then subject to an additional one year retention period, with the balance
subject to a two year period.
The following table sets out the Awards made under the 2004(b) LTIP to the Executive Directors:
The Remuneration Committee's policy is designed to incentivise the Executive Directors to maximise the total return to
shareholders. In the Remuneration Committee's opinion this will be achieved by incentivising the Executive Directors to not
only ensure that  12 per share is returned to shareholders but also by providing them with a direct share in the residual
value of the Company. As a result the value of the awards is directly linked to the value of the residual Company following
the return and as such there is a close alignment between the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders, both
of whom benefit from a maximum value for the residual part of the Company.

The Remuneration Committee will determine whether the performance condition has been satisfied by ensuring the
redemption payments have been made in the allotted time frame.
Dilution
Excluding The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) LTIP the Company has operated its executive and all employee
arrangements within the ABI dilution limits. The 2004(b) LTIP will provide the long-term share incentive for Executive
Directors during its life. The Board has currently determined that no new equity based arrangements which will be satisfied
by the issue of shares or the transfer of treasury shares will be introduced to replace the closed share arrangements set
out above. 
Pension 
Policy: Lower quartile to median
The Executive Directors are all members of one or more of the following pensions schemes in operation within the Group,
namely The Berkeley Group Staff Benefits Plan, The Berkeley Homes Executive Pension Plan and The St George PLC
Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme. No element of remuneration other than basic salary is pensionable.
Three Directors have benefits accruing to them under a defined contribution scheme and three have benefits accruing
to them under a defined benefits scheme. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in these schemes.
Details of pension costs for Executive Directors are set out, in the audited section of the report on page 36.
Benefits in kind
Policy: Market practice
In line with market practice, the Company's policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional benefits:
  a fully expensed company car; and
  medical insurance.
Other remuneration matters
All employee share schemes
The Company's current all employee share schemes were closed to new awards on the Court approval of the reconstruction
of the Company on 30 October 2004. Traditional all employee plans such as Share Incentive Plans and SAYE Schemes
cannot be operated by the Company after the reconstruction as its Units do not qualify under the relevant legislation.
Therefore, the Company is intending to operate an all employee long-term cash based bonus plan called The Berkeley
Group Holdings plc 2005 Share Appreciation Rights Plan. This Plan provides all employees of the Company (excluding
Executive Directors) with the opportunity of being granted rights on an annual basis to receive Share Appreciation Rights
which will normally vest three years after the date of grant and subject to continued employment. Share Appreciation Rights
will consist of a number of  phantom Units' with an exercise price set at the market price of a unit on the date of grant.
On the exercise of Share Appreciation Rights an employee will be entitled to receive a cash payment equivalent to the
difference between the adjusted market price of a Unit (adding back redemption payments made since the date of grant)
less the exercise price multiplied by the number of phantom Units being exercised.
Non-Executive Directors' fees
Policy: Upper decile fees
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within
the limits set by the articles of association. The 2005 fee levels are based on a specific survey of the fees paid to Non-
Executive Directors in the comparator group by Halliwell Consulting. The basic fee paid to each Non-Executive Director in
the year was  36,400 per annum and  45,500 for the Senior Independent Director. Further fees are payable for additional
work performed in respect of the Chairmanship of the Remuneration and Audit Remuneration Committees ( 5,000 p.a.).
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Company's share incentive schemes or performance based plans
and are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme. 
An additional  60,000 of fees was paid to Mrs Mitchell in shares during the year ending 30 April 2005. This payment was
made because the Board of Berkeley believed that it was appropriate to pay Mrs Mitchell this additional remuneration to
recognise the very significant time she spent during 2004 discharging her duties as Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee. This was far in excess of that normally associated with the position and required Mrs Mitchell to forego other
works and consulting opportunities during this period. The Board of Berkeley consulted with major shareholders about this
payment and thought it appropriate to make the payment in shares. 34 www.berkeleygroup.co.uk

Executive Directors' contracts
The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations. The only event
on the occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on
cessation of employment; with the maximum payment being 12 months' salary. No payment is due on either a Company
takeover or in the event of liquidation. In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss. Further, the
Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure. None of the Executive Directors'
contracts provides for liquidated damages. There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors'
contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company. Further, there are no special
provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Director's cessation of employment with the Company.
Non-Executive Directors
All non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon
retirement by rotation as required by the Company's articles of association. All letters of appointment for Non-Executive
Directors are renewable annually on 1 May.

The transfer values of the Directors' accrued benefits under the Defined Benefit Plan, as set out above, are calculated in
accordance with the  Retirement Benefits Scheme - Transfer Values (GN11)' published by the Institute of Actuaries and the
Faculty of Actuaries. The transfer values disclosed above represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need
to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the liability in respect of qualifying services. As such they represent
a potential liability of the pension scheme. These transfer values do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual
Director and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration. Members of the fund have the the option to
pay additional voluntary contributions; neither these contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the transfer values
in the table above.
In addition to the above, the Company made the following contributions to defined contribution plans:

(after the redemption of the 5p 2004 B share). This disclosure is unaudited, but included in this table for the convenience of the readers of the accounts.
The mid-market share price of The Berkeley Group plc was 980.0p as at 1 May 2004 and the mid-market share price
of the Company was 770.0p as at 30 April 2005. The mid-market high and low share prices of The Berkeley Group plc

At the date of this report, the interests of A W Pidgley in the ordinary share capital of the Company have increased by 49,183
Units to 2,135,079 Units, the interests of A Carey have increased by 9,508 Units to 233,736 Units and the interests of R C
Perrins have increased by 21,312 Units to 71,568 Units.
Following the Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement, the Scheme triggered the rights of participants to exercise
options under the Group's share option schemes which would not otherwise have been exercisable. The effect of this is
described where relevant below. Where performance conditions remain for the option schemes, these are set out below:
(1) 2000 Approved Plan: Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement, in accordance with the Plan's rules, resulted in immediate vesting of options under the Scheme without
reference to satisfaction of the performance conditions unless the Remuneration Committee deemed otherwise. The Remuneration Committee determined that these options
became exercisable on the Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement for a period of six months.
(2) 1996 Scheme: under this Scheme, the shares under option are released subject to the Company's average yearly EPS growth being at least as much as the increase in RPI + 3%
in each year over three consecutive years. On Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement, and in accordance with the rules of the Scheme, options under the 1996 Scheme
became exercisable for a period of six months.
(3) SAYE Scheme: on Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement, and in accordance with the rules of the Scheme, options under the Scheme became exercisable to the extent
of savings and interest up to the date of exercise, for a period of six months.
(4) 2000 Plan: these options were released during the year in consideration for a conditional cash compensation payment. See below for details.
For all options exercised in the period from 1 May 2004 to Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement on 
25 October 2004, performance conditions were fully met.
The mid-market share price of the Company on 26 October 2004 was 1,180.0p and on 22 November 2004 was 1,205.0p.
Aggregate gains made by Directors on the exercise of share options in the year amounted to  125,397 (2004:  132,120).
38 www.berkeleygroup.co.uk Under the 2000 Plan, Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement, in accordance with the Plan's rules, resulted in
immediate vesting of options under the Plan without reference to satisfaction of the performance conditions unless the
Remuneration Committee deemed otherwise. The Remuneration Committee determined to offer all participants with options
the opportunity of either exchanging options for options over Units after the reconstruction, or of releasing their options in
consideration for a conditional cash payment. The basis of calculation of this compensation payment is explained on
page 31 and will only be provided if the participant is an employee of the Company at the original vesting date for the
option. Mr Pidgley chose the conditional compensation payment in respect of these options. The conditional cash payments
are set out in the table below:
