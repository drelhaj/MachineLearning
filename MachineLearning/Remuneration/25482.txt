 remuneration report
Introduction
This report is made by the Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. The first part of the report provides details 
of BG Group's remuneration policy. The second part provides details of the remuneration, service contracts and share interests of all the
Directors for the year ended 31 December 2002. The Directors confirm that this report has been drawn up in accordance with Schedule B 
of the Combined Code.
Responsibility for reviewing Group remuneration strategy and policy, recommending any changes and approving individual remuneration
packages for Executive Directors rests with the Remuneration Committee. The Committee consists exclusively of independent non-executive
Directors and meets on at least four occasions each year. The members are: Peter Backhouse, David Benson, Sir John Coles, Paul Collins,
Elwyn Eilledge (Committee Chairman), Sir Richard Giordano, Keith Mackrell, Dame Stella Rimington and Lord Sharman; Emma Nichol, Company
Secretary, attends as secretary to the Committee. Frank Chapman, Chief Executive, Peter Duffy, Executive Vice President Human Resources,
and Cathy Aldwinckle, Head of Compensation and Benefits, attend these meetings as required and provide information and advice to 
the Committee to enable it to make informed decisions. The Remuneration Committee also meets without management and receives
information and independent executive remuneration advice from an external consultancy firm, Towers Perrin
(i)
, whose appointment
was approved by the Remuneration Committee.
During 2001, the Remuneration Committee reviewed BG's global remuneration strategy and proposed some changes, principally to our 
long-term incentive schemes. Those changes were approved by shareholders at the 2002 Annual General Meeting and have since been
implemented
(ii)
. Other than as detailed on page 63, no changes are proposed to the remuneration policy this year. The Committee will 
review the policy on a regular basis and recommend changes as and when appropriate in forthcoming years.
REMUNERATION POLICY
BG needs to be able to employ and retain international employees of the highest calibre with the necessary skills, capabilities and
experience to execute its business strategy and thereby deliver strong growth. The catchment area for recruitment is increasingly outside
the UK and the required talent is scarce.
The overriding objectives of our remuneration policy are to enable the recruitment and retention of this limited executive resource and to
reinforce our strong performance ethic.
Accordingly, the central premise of our remuneration policy is that, whilst reward arrangements should be market competitive, employees
should look to performance related incentives rather than base salaries to achieve above average reward.
To implement our policy, we have a well-developed, company-wide performance management system and we operate three complementary
performance related incentive schemes for executives. The three schemes are the Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS), the Long Term Incentive
Scheme (LTIS) and the Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS). These schemes form a significant proportion of the total reward package for
executives.
The AIS is designed to focus executives on the business priorities for the financial year and to reinforce our individual performance culture.
The aim of the LTIS is to motivate participants to maximise total shareholder return (TSR)
(iii)
as measured against a comparator group 
of international oil and gas companies over a period of three years. The CSOS aims to drive real earnings growth over the long term, the
mechanism used for measuring this being published earnings per share (EPS)
(iv)
growth relative to the growth in the retail price index,
excluding mortgage interest repayments (RPIX). Further details of the AIS, the LTIS and the CSOS can be found on pages 61 to 63.
The varying performance periods and performance conditions of the three schemes combine and complement each other to enable the
measurement and reward of both short- and long-term performance and of absolute (AIS), sustained (CSOS) and comparative (LTIS) financial
performance. The Remuneration Committee considers that this combination of performance measures aligns executives' interests with
those of shareholders and establishes a clear link between pay and performance.
Components of Remuneration
The current remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises performance related and non-performance related components.
The performance related components are the performance related incentive schemes referred to above and the non-performance related
components are base salary, taxable benefits and pension entitlements. In addition, the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the
Company's all-employee share schemes. Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group and the provisions of Schedule A to the
Combined Code have been taken into account in determining the remuneration packages for Executive Directors.
The proportion of each Executive Director's total remuneration that is performance related is significant even for target (which is based 
on budget) performance. For stretch (significantly above budget) performance, the amount of remuneration payable is higher as is the
proportion that is performance related. New legislation (the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002) requires us to explain 
the relative importance of those elements of remuneration which are, and those which are not, performance related. In fulfilling this
requirement, we have had to make a number of assumptions, including what the Company's share price growth will be over the next three
years and what our total shareholder return will be relative to that of a comparator group of companies. Based on such assumptions, the
average proportion of remuneration that is performance related for target performance is approximately 45% for Executive Directors.
For stretch performance, the average is about 75%.
60 BG GROUP PLC 2002
(i) Towers Perrin also provides some general compensation and benefits advice and information to some of our overseas activities and is responsible for the administration of some 
of our share schemes.
(ii) Details of these changes can be found on pages 52-55 in the Company's 2001 Annual Report and Accounts.
(iii) TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained from holding a company's shares over a period. It includes dividends paid, the change in the capital value of the shares 
and other payments to, or by, shareholders within the period.
(iv) EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings for the financial year (excluding exceptional items) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and ranking for dividend
during the year. Base Salaries
Executive Directors' salaries are reviewed each year on 1 April and this review takes into account individual performance and market
competitiveness. Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only.
In line with our remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee benchmarks Executive Directors' salaries against a comparator group.
Given BG's international presence and position roughly in the middle of the FTSE 50, the Remuneration Committee considered it appropriate
to reference Executive Directors' base salaries for the 1 April 2002 salary review against the median of the FTSE 50. We will use the same
comparator group for the 1 April 2003 salary review.
Annual Incentive Scheme
The Company operates a cash-based Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS), which provides an incentive opportunity in the range of 0% to 100% 
of base salary.
At the start of the incentive year (1 January), based on the Company's business priorities, the Remuneration Committee sets both the
performance measures and the targets. These targets ensure that incentives at the higher end of the range are payable only for
demonstrably superior Company and individual performance.
For the Executive Directors and other members of the Group Executive Committee, the financial performance measure for the 2002 incentive
year was EPS, adjusted to take into account the volatility of upstream commodity prices. For the 2003 incentive year, the Remuneration
Committee has agreed that the financial performance measures for Executive Directors and other members of the Group Executive
Committee will be EPS (again adjusted for commodity prices) and return on average capital employed (ROACE)
(i)
.
When determining incentive payments, the Remuneration Committee considers health, safety and environmental performance in addition
to absolute and underlying financial performance. When setting targets for 2002, the Remuneration Committee could not have foreseen 
the introduction of the North Sea tax surcharge. The Remuneration Committee therefore decided to exclude the adverse effects of the
surcharge when it determined the 2002 AIS payments. Payments in respect of the 2002 incentive year will be made in April 2003 based on
2002 results. The payments are non-pensionable.
Long-Term Incentives - Estimated Present Value
During 2001, the Remuneration Committee sought external, independent advice from Towers Perrin to establish an objective measure to
describe the value at the time of grant or allocation of long-term incentives which may, or may not, pay out in the future. This measure 
is referred to as the Estimated Present Value (EPV). The EPV takes account of the risk that all grants and allocations may be forfeited.
This EPV is then used to determine the appropriate levels of face value CSOS grants and LTIS allocations.
The changes approved by shareholders last year enable the Remuneration Committee to make awards under both schemes, up to a maximum
combined EPV of 175% of base salary each year. However, we stated the intention of the committee that long-term incentive grants in 2002
would not exceed a maximum combined EPV of 130% of base salary. The actual maximum combined EPV granted during 2002 was slightly less
than 130%.
Each year, the Remuneration Committee decides on the appropriate blend of CSOS grants and LTIS allocations that will be made to Executive
Directors within the maximum combined EPV. Awards will always be made under both schemes, with not less than one-third and not more
than two-thirds of the total combined EPV being delivered by either scheme. When making this decision, the Remuneration Committee
takes a number of factors into consideration including cost, the need to remain within scheme dilution limits and the performance
conditions considered to be key to BG Group's strategy at the time of the allocation or grant. For the 2002 awards, the Executive Directors
received two-thirds of the total combined EPV through the LTIS and one-third through the CSOS.
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS)
Currently, a limited number of high performing employees deemed to be making a significant contribution to the Company's long-term TSR
performance are allocated Company shares under the LTIS. This allocation marks the beginning of the performance period. The Company's
TSR performance against that of a comparator group over the three year period will determine what proportion of the allocated shares 
will be transferred into the ownership of the employee. The Remuneration Committee considers that measuring performance against a
comparator group of companies ensures that executives are rewarded not solely based on BG Group's performance but also relative to the
performance of the other companies in the comparator group. The TSR performance is measured by the independent external corporate
broker, Hoare Govett Limited, a subsidiary of ABN Amro Holding NV.
The LTIS comparator group for the 2002 allocation comprises 21 international oil and gas companies (including BG Group plc) of which 12 
are headquartered in the USA, three in the UK and six elsewhere in Europe
(ii)
.
This group has been chosen because the Remuneration Committee believes that it comprises our major business competitors i.e. those
companies against which BG is compared by shareholders.
BG GROUP PLC 2002 61
(i) Average capital employed consists of total shareholders' funds plus net borrowings averaged between the start and end of year. ROACE represents total operating profit before
exceptional items less BG's share of net interest receivable and payable by joint ventures and associated undertakings and the interest charge relating to the unwinding of discount
on provisions as a percentage of average capital employed.
(ii) A different comparator group was used for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 allocations. remuneration report continued
The other companies in the comparator group are as follows:
Amerada Hess Corporation El Paso Corporation Repsol YPF SA
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation ENI SpA Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.
BP plc ExxonMobil Corporation Shell Transport & Trading Co. plc
Burlington Resources Inc. Kerr McGee Corporation Statoil ASA
ChevronTexaco Corporation Marathon Oil Corporation TotalFinaElf SA
ConocoPhillips Petroleum Norsk Hydro ASA Unocal Corporation
Duke Energy Corporation Occidental Petroleum Corporation
For the 1999, 2000 and 2001 allocations, the Remuneration Committee set the following performance conditions:
- 100% of the allocated shares will be transferred only if upper quartile TSR performance is achieved;
- only 40% of the allocated shares will be transferred if median TSR performance is achieved. A proportion of between 40% and 100% 
of the allocated shares will be transferred for between median and upper quartile performance;
- where TSR performance is below the median, all of the allocated shares will be forfeited. There is no retest provision.
The performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee for the 2002 allocation are more stringent than for previous allocations
and are as follows:
- 100% of the allocated shares will be transferred only if  Number One' TSR performance position is achieved;
- 75% of the allocated shares will be transferred if upper quartile TSR performance is achieved. A proportion of between 75% and 100% 
of the allocated shares will be transferred for between upper quartile and  Number One' performance;
- only 30% of the allocated shares will be transferred if median TSR performance is achieved. A proportion of between 30% and 75% 
of the allocated shares will be transferred for between median and upper quartile performance;
- where TSR performance is below the median, all the allocated shares will be forfeited. There is no retest provision.
In the event of a change of control, vesting of shares under the LTIS is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the
performance conditions had been met at the time.
An allocation of shares was made under the LTIS in October 1999 to UK payroll employees and overseas employees above a certain level of
seniority. The performance period for the allocation ended on 30 September 2002. BG's final position in the comparator group meant that
46% of the original allocation of shares was put into trust on behalf of participating employees. Subject to the rules of the LTIS, the shares
will be transferred to those employees in October 2003.
Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS)
Approximately 1 200 employees are currently eligible to participate in the BG Group CSOS including UK payroll employees and overseas
employees above a certain level of seniority.
The Company grants an option over its shares to each eligible employee and the option price is set at the fair market value at the time of
the grant. As described below, the CSOS measures performance according to EPS growth relative to the growth in RPIX. The Remuneration
Committee considers that the inclusion of an EPS performance measure ensures that executives only receive rewards when the Company
has achieved sustained earnings growth during the performance period. To the extent that the performance target has been met three
years from the date of grant, the option may be exercised (in whole or in part) at any time up to the expiry of ten years from the date 
of grant.
In 2002, the levels of grant made to individual employees were differentiated based on each individual's performance to date and
expectation of future contributions. For the 2002 grant, the Remuneration Committee set the following performance targets, which it
considers to be particularly demanding. These targets also apply to the 2000 and the 2001 grants:
- for all of the option to become exercisable, the Company must achieve EPS growth over three years of RPIX plus 30%;
- only half of the option will be exercisable if EPS growth over three years is RPIX plus 15%. A proportion of between half and all of the
option will be exercisable if the Company achieves EPS growth over three years of RPIX plus between 15 and 30%;
- if the Company's EPS growth over three years is less than RPIX plus 15%, all the option will be forfeited.
Fixed point retesting is allowed in years four and five, in which EPS growth of RPIX plus 40% or plus 50% respectively must be achieved for
all the option to become exercisable. This ensures that management is motivated to make the right decisions for the long-term growth 
of value without compromising the stretching performance conditions. At the end of year five, the option will be exercisable only to the
extent that the performance conditions have been met.
In the event of a change of control, exercise of the option under the CSOS is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which 
the performance conditions had been met at the time.
62 BG GROUP PLC 2002 Currently, grants to individuals under the CSOS are subject to a limit based on the aggregate of awards made within the preceding 
12 month period. This is inconsistent with the individual limit contained in the LTIS, which is based on allocations made in a calendar year.
This timing differential limits the Remuneration Committee's flexibility when apportioning the combined EPV of awards appropriately
between CSOS and LTIS on an annual basis.
It is therefore proposed to amend the CSOS to bring the grant basis into line with the LTIS, such that the limits on grants to individuals will
be based on grants made in a calendar year for both schemes. Approval will be sought from shareholders at the 2003 Annual General
Meeting to this amendment. This will ensure that the Remuneration Committee has the flexibility under each scheme to determine the
appropriate blend of awards under CSOS and LTIS that may be made to Executive Directors. This is a technical, rather than substantive,
amendment. It will not result in increased annual grants being made.
All-Employee Share Schemes
In order to encourage share ownership, the Company currently provides two all-employee share schemes for its UK employees, the Share
Incentive Plan (SIP) and the Sharesave Scheme.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
The BG Group SIP is approved by the Inland Revenue. There are two parts to the SIP - the Partnership Shares Plan and the Free Shares Plan.
(i) Partnership Shares 
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity to buy Company shares from pre-tax earnings as part of a regular share purchase plan.
Shares are currently purchased every six months using employees' accumulated deductions and placed in trust. The third Partnership Share
purchase was made in October 2002. Sixty-one per cent of eligible employees participate in this plan, of which 66% are contributing the
maximum of  125 per month.
(ii) Free Shares
A Free Shares award of 983 shares was made in May 2002 to all eligible employees in the UK based on BG's performance during 2001.
These shares will be held in trust for up to five years.
For 2002, the Board will allow awards of Free Shares in the Company to be made up to a value of  3 000 (the statutory limit) for each
individual. All eligible employees will receive the same number of shares. This number will be determined based on the extent to which 
the Company has met the agreed profit targets for 2002.
Sharesave Scheme
The Company continued to operate the BG Group Sharesave Scheme in 2002. The scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue and provides
for eligible employees to acquire the Company's shares with the proceeds of a monthly savings contract. The contract period is three or five
years. Eighty-one per cent of eligible employees currently participate in the Sharesave Scheme, contributing an average monthly payment
of  207 (the maximum being  250).
Employee Profit Sharing Scheme
This scheme ceased to operate at the end of 2000. During 2002, shares allocated to participants in respect of the 1998 scheme were
released and transferred into their names.
Shares held in respect of the 1999 and 2000 schemes will be released to eligible participants in 2003 and 2004 respectively.
Shareholding Guidelines
During 2002, shareholding guidelines were introduced for Executive Directors, Group Executive Committee members and certain other
senior employees to encourage substantial long-term share ownership. These require that over a period of five years Executive Directors
build up and then retain a holding of shares with a value equivalent to twice base salary. The required holding for other members of the
Group Executive Committee is one-times base salary. The guidelines require that, in relation to 2002 and future LTIS allocations, vested
shares (net of tax) should be retained by the individual until the required shareholding level is reached.
Service Contracts
The Executive Directors' service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Remuneration
Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate Directors of the quality required to manage the Company. The Remuneration
Committee considers that a notice period of one year is appropriate.
The Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control provisions. Should the Directors' employment be terminated within 
12 months of a change of control, they are entitled to liquidated damages. The amount of liquidated damages is equal to one year's then
gross salary and a credit of one year's pensionable service (less any deductions the employer is required to make), which the Remuneration
Committee considers to be a genuine pre-estimate of loss. The Remuneration Committee considers that these clauses assist with
recruitment and retention and that their inclusion is therefore in the best interests of shareholders.
Other than change of control clauses, the Executive Directors' service contracts do not contain provisions for compensation in the event of
early termination. When calculating termination payments, the Remuneration Committee takes into account a variety of factors including
individual and Company performance, the obligation for the Director to mitigate his or her own loss (for example by gaining new
employment), the Director's age and length of service. Further details of the Executive Directors' service contracts can be found on pages 65
and 66.
BG GROUP PLC 2002 63 remuneration report continued
Non-Executive Directors
The Board aims to recruit non-executive Directors of a high calibre with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience.
Non-executive Directors are generally appointed for an initial three year period. The terms of their engagement are set out in a letter of
appointment
(i)
. The initial appointment and any subsequent re-appointment is subject to election or re-election by shareholders. The letters
of appointment do not contain notice periods or provision for termination payments.
Non-executive Directors are paid a basic fee
(ii)
. Additional fees are also payable, for example, for chairing a committee of the Board or acting
as Deputy Chairman. The level of Directors' fees is reviewed against market practice every two years, taking into account the required time
commitment. The next review takes place this year.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company's share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.
Performance Graph
The graph below shows BG Group's total shareholder return performance since listing (calculated in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002) against the FTSE 100. We have chosen the FTSE 100 because this is a recognised broad equity market

BG GROUP PLC 2002 65 remuneration report continued
Change of control
As described on page 63, the Executive Directors' employment contracts contain change of control provisions.
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company;
or if 50% or more of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become
vested in any individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert; or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and
undertakings of the Company become owned by any person, firm or company (other than a subsidiary or associated company). A change of
control is also deemed to occur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of
that company (including its subsidiaries) is transferred to another company unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company,
or a company ultimately owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company. However, a change of
control does not occur if (and, only if) through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company owned
by substantially the same shareholders, as are the shareholders of the Company.
The Executive Directors' employment contracts provide that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made less any
deductions the employer is required to make and shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against
the employer or any associated company arising out of the termination of employment except for any personal injury claim, any claim in
respect of accrued pension rights or statutory employment protection claims.

(i) The October 1999 notional allocation was reconstituted after demerger using the average share prices of the first ten days of trading of the shares of the Company and Lattice
Group plc immediately following demerger, as proportions of the aggregate of the two to produce the appropriate factors for adjustment. As a result, the initial allocation 
price was decreased from 376.46p to 245.73p and the initial allocation was increased by a factor of 1.532008 in the BG Group New Long Term Incentive Scheme. As a result of
the performance criteria measured in October 2002, 46% of this notional allocation of shares is now subject to the one year retention period (the remainder of the allocation
has lapsed). These shares will be transferred to the Executive Directors on 1 October 2003 when the retention period ends.
(ii) The transfer of shares is dependent on the achievement of performance criteria at the end of a three year performance period followed by a further one year retention period,
except for the awards made in September 2002, for which no retention period applies. The performance periods end in November 2003, November 2004 and September 2005
respectively for the notional allocations made in November 2000, November 2001 and September 2002.
(iii) Dividends paid on shares held in trust may, at the discretion of the trustees, be reinvested in BG Group plc shares by the trustees and held on behalf of the Executive Directors
until the normal release date of the respective allocations. On 23 December 2002, the trustees reinvested the interim dividend as follows: Ashley Almanza - 33 shares, Frank
Chapman - 449 shares and William Friedrich - 309 shares.
(iv) Andrew Bonfield ceased to be an Executive Director on 16 August 2002 following his resignation. As a result of his resignation, all his notional allocations lapsed immediately.
The notional allocation of shares received by Andrew Bonfield in March 2001, following his appointment as Executive Director, was in line with the allocations made to the
other Executive Directors in November 2000, following the demerger of Lattice Group plc. The allocation made to him in November 2001 was made partly under the terms of
the BG Group New Long Term Incentive Scheme and partly as a special one-off allocation on identical terms. The latter was made following consultation with the Financial
Services Authority and served to bring his allocation in line with the allocations of the other Executive Directors.
Market prices at the date of the awards were as follows: 3 November 2000 - 265.5p, 22 November 2001 - 261p, and 5 September 2002 -
251.75p. Market price at the date of the reinvestment of dividends was as follows: 23 December 2002 - 263p.
The performance conditions for the Scheme are set out on pages 61 to 62.

(iii) Andrew Bonfield ceased to be an Executive Director on 16 August 2002 following his resignation. As a result of his resignation all his options lapsed. The award of 135 004 share
options in March 2001 was made following his appointment as Executive Director, Finance in January 2001. His award of 296 481 share options in November 2001 was made
partly under the terms of the BG Group Company Share Option Scheme and partly as a special one-off award on identical terms. The latter was made following consultation
with the Financial Services Authority and served to bring his awards in line with the awards of other Executive Directors in the same manner as under the 
BG Group New Long Term Incentive Scheme (see above).
The performance measure for the Scheme is set out on page 62.
The closing price of an ordinary share on 31 December 2002 was 268p. The range during the year was 313p (high) and 230.75p (low).
These figures are derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange.

(v) Paul Collins' holding is in the form of 20 000 ADRs.
OTHER INTERESTS
There have been no changes in the interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings
between 1 January 2003 and 21 February 2003. As of 21 February 2003, the Directors' interest in the share capital of the Company represents
less than 1% of the issued share capital of the Company.
PENSIONS
All the Executive Directors were members of the BG Pension Scheme throughout the year. They are all subject to the earnings cap, which is a
restriction on the amount of pay that can be used to calculate pensions payable from a UK tax approved pension scheme. The Company has
agreed to increase their retirement benefits (including contingent death benefits) by means of an unapproved arrangement, the 
BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme, to at least the level which would otherwise have been provided had they not been subject to the
earnings cap. Provision has been made in respect of the additional obligations for these post-retirement benefits.
68 BG GROUP PLC 2002 BG GROUP PLC 2002 69
The arrangements for Frank Chapman and William Friedrich have not changed during the year. They provide an accrual of benefits designed 
to target a pension equivalent to two-thirds of their final 12 months' salary on retirement from BG at age 60, inclusive of pension rights earned
either in previous employments or previous pension arrangements. On appointment as an Executive Director with effect from 1 August 2002,
Ashley Almanza's pension arrangements were aligned with those of the other Executive Directors. Prior to that date he accrued benefits on
the standard basis applicable to UK employees.
As for all members of the BG Pension Scheme, if the Company consents to retirement, no actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable
from age 55, provided 10 years' service has been completed with the Group (which includes pensionable service transferred from previous
employment). Pensions in payment are increased in line with retail price inflation. An adult dependant's pension is payable on death in service,
equal to two-thirds of that payable to the pension scheme member based on potential service to retirement age. On death in retirement an
adult dependant's pension is payable equal to two-thirds of the member's pension prior to exchanging any of it for a cash lump sum.
Andrew Bonfield was entitled to pension arrangements on the same basis as the other Executive Directors. However, when he left the
Company on 16 August 2002, he had completed less than two years' pensionable service. A member leaving in such circumstances may request
a transfer payment within a specific period but this opportunity was not taken up. He therefore received a refund of his own contributions and
has no continuing entitlement to benefits under the BG Pension Scheme or the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme.
Directors' pension provisions were as follows:

(i) The figures for Ashley Almanza relate only to the period for which he has been an Executive Director i.e. from 1 August 2002.
(ii) As at 1 August 2002 for Ashley Almanza.
(iii) The increase in pension and transfer value for Frank Chapman (and also for William Friedrich) arises from the fact that his pensionable service has increased by one year and 
his pensionable salary has increased during the year, and not from any change to his pension promise. However, as at 31 December 2001 Frank Chapman's pensionable salary 
was restricted by notional Inland Revenue limits. This resulted in a reduced accrued pension and transfer value at that date, but the limits did not impact on his 31 December 
2002 pensionable salary. Consequently, his increase in accrued pension and transfer value over the year reflect not only a year of pension accrual but also the change from a
pensionable salary which was limited to one which was not. If the effect of the latter is removed, his increase in accrued pension over the year is  33 000 and his increase in
transfer value is  459 000.
(iv) The transfer values shown at the end of 2001 and 2002 represent the value of each Executive Director's accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant date.
The accrued pensions are the amounts that would have been paid if the Executive Director had left service at the relevant date. The transfer values have been calculated in
accordance with guidance note  GN11' issued by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
To broaden the experience of Executive Directors, it is Company policy to allow each of them to accept one external appointment as 
a non-executive director of another company, the fees for which would be retained by the individual Director.
