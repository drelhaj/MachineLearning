 Board report on remuneration 
The remuneration committee (the Committee ) determines the remuneration of the executive Directors and makes
recommendations to the Board of any changes to the terms and conditions of employment of executive Directors. The Committee
consists of four independent non-executive Directors: Ken Clarke (Committee Chairman), Neil Cross, Adrian Loader and Patrick
Ponsolle. Jeff Harris, Ian Meakins and Stefano Pessina attend meetings by invitation in advisory capacities but are not present when
their own remuneration is discussed.
Remuneration policy
The aim of the Group's remuneration policy is to maximise the position of the Group in the European healthcare sector by attracting,
retaining and motivating the highest calibre of executive Directors and senior executives, aligning the rewards of those individuals
with the interests of shareholders by linking part of their remuneration package to the performance of the Group and the creation of
long-term shareholder value.
In implementing the remuneration policy, the Committee has considered the principles in the Code with regard to Directors' remuneration.
In accordance with the remuneration policy, the remuneration of executive Directors is made up of a combination of basic salary, 
non-cash benefits, annual performance bonus, long-term incentive plan benefits, share options and pension benefits, all of which are
detailed below. The executive Directors' remuneration is reviewed at the end of each calendar year. No Director is permitted to vote in
respect of their own remuneration.
Service contracts
Ian Meakins, George Fairweather, Per Utnegaard and Steve Duncan are employed under contracts that can be terminated by either
party with notice of 12 months. Stefano Pessina and Ornella Barra have service contracts that can be terminated by the Group with
notice of 12 months or by each of them with notice of six months. There are provisions in the service contracts for payment in lieu 
of current salary to cover the required notice period. Were the situation to arise, the Company intends to apply the principle of
mitigation to any payment of compensation on termination as a result of unsatisfactory performance. 
Geoff Cooper resigned from the Board and from the role of Deputy Chief Executive on 29 July 2004 when the decision to appoint Ian
Meakins was finalised and he left the Company at the end of the year. His emoluments for the year as a Director and employee and
his payment for loss of office are set out in the emoluments section of this report. The principle of mitigation was not applicable as his
departure was not as a result of unsatisfactory performance.
The dates of the executive Directors' current service contracts are:

The Company recognises that its executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive Directors of other listed companies and
that such duties can broaden experience and knowledge which benefit the Company. Executive Directors are therefore allowed to
accept one external non-executive appointment with the Company's prior approval, as long as this is not in any way connected with
the Company's business and would not lead to any conflict of interest. Fees received by the Director may be retained.
Ian Meakins is a non-executive Director of mmO

and retained fees for that appointment of  4,167 during the period he was Chief
Executive. Stefano Pessina is a non-executive Director of Galenica, an associate company. He waived his entitlement to fees as part of
the agreement with Galenica on reciprocal board representation. George Fairweather is a non-executive Director of Mitchells & Butlers
and retained fees paid of  49,500 in 2004 for that appointment. Per Utnegaard was appointed a non-executive Director of the Davis
Service Group in January 2005 and will retain fees payable. Geoff Cooper was appointed non-executive Director of Abbey National in
January 2004 and served until 1 December 2004. He retained fees paid of  52,000 in 2004 for that appointment. 
Jeff Harris is a Director of Andreae-Noris Zahn, an associate company, the fees payable being retained by the Company.

Salaries
The setting of basic salary reflects the committee's assessment of the market rate for relevant positions, taking into account the levels
of responsibility, the individual Director's experience and their contribution to the Group. For determining basic salary in 2004 and
2005, the committee appointed and received advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - Monks Partnership. PwC provide
remuneration and other consultancy services directly to the Company. The amount paid to each Director in 2004 is detailed in the
emoluments section on page 47.
Following a report from PwC in December 2004, the remuneration committee reviewed salaries payable to the executive Directors
based on market related base salary data from a comparator group of companies consisting of 20 companies from the 25 smallest FTSE
100 companies by market capitalisation (excluding financial companies) and 20 companies from the 25 largest FTSE 250 companies by
market capitalisation (excluding financial companies). Salary increases, which are effective from 1 January 2005, were based on this
data after taking account of the performance of each Director. 
Executive Directors' basic salaries at 1 January 2005 are as follows:
Director  
I. K. Meakins 625,000
S. Pessina 485,000
G. R. Fairweather 375,000
O. Barra 310,000
P. Utnegaard 315,000
S. W. J. Duncan 315,000
Benefits
Benefits available to executive Directors relate to the provision of company cars or a car allowance, private medical insurance, and, for
Stefano Pessina and Ornella Barra, the cost of travel to and from work, accommodation and subsistence while working for the Group
in the UK. The provision of these benefits reflects market practice and do not relate to performance. The value of these benefits for
each Director in 2004, including expenses chargeable to UK income tax, are detailed in the emoluments section on page 47. Where a
Director is entitled to a benefit but chooses not to take that benefit, a cash supplement is paid in lieu of that benefit.
Salary supplements
Salary supplements include cash payments and long-term financial provision. 
Annual performance bonuses
The annual performance bonus scheme rewards executive Directors for the Group and individual divisions for which they are
responsible for achieving their budgeted performance, after the cost of bonuses. Payments also take into account personal
performance. The maximum bonus an executive Director could receive in 2004 was 50% of their basic salary. In 2004 the budgeted
performance was based on the challenging but achievable 2004 budget for earnings, before amortisation of intangible assets and
exceptional items, at constant exchange rates, agreed by the Board at the end of the previous year. Depending upon responsibilities, 
a bonus of between 5% and 15% was payable for performance of 100% of the Group or Group and divisional performance, rising to
40% for performance of 105% of the Group and divisional budgeted performance. Personal performance was based on a 360 
appraisal process and determined by the remuneration committee. Depending on responsibilities, a bonus of up to 15% was payable
based on this appraisal. 
The Committee has agreed that the maximum bonus opportunity for 2005 will be increased from 50% of base salary to 100%. 
The Committee is satisfied that the new level is commensurate with that in companies of a similar size and complexity to Alliance
UniChem. Depending on the responsibilities of an individual Director, 80% of the bonus will be based on Group and/or divisional
financial results and 20% of the bonus will be based on personal performance. A target bonus of 40% of base salary will be paid for 
the achievement of a stretching target which exceeds budget. Bonuses will start to accrue on the achievement of 96% of the stretch
target and the maximum bonus of 80% will be paid for achieving 104% of target.
Ian Meakins earned a bonus payment of  300,000 in 2004 to compensate him for the lost opportunity to earn a bonus from his
previous employer in 2004. This bonus was based on Group performance targets. 
The amounts earned by each Director are detailed in the emoluments section on page 47. Board report on remuneration
Non-executive Directors
All non-executive Directors were entitled to a basic fee of  35,000 in 2004. Jeff Harris, as non-executive Chairman, earned a total fee of
 250,000 per annum. Ken Clarke (Deputy Chairman and senior independent non-executive Director) earned a total fee of  125,000 per
annum, which included  5,000 per annum for chairing the remuneration committee. Neil Cross received a total fee of  46,000, which
included a fee of  1,000 for chairing and serving on the Board of Alliance UniChem Pension Trustee Limited for one month, (the fee is
based on  10,000 per annum) and  10,000 per annum for chairing and serving on the audit committee. Other members of the audit
committee were paid an additional fee of  5,000 per annum. Manfred Stach was unable to attend any audit committee meetings 
in 2004 due to other commitments entered into before his appointment to the Board, and, as a result, he waived his 2004 audit
committee fee of  5,000. The fees paid reflect the time non-executive Directors are required to commit to their duties and amounts
paid to non-executives in comparable companies. 
The Board reviewed fees payable to non-executive Directors in January 2005, based on advice received by the executive Directors from
PwC, which compared the level of fees paid by a comparator group of companies consisting of 20 companies from the 25 smallest
FTSE 100 companies by market capitalisation (excluding financial companies) and 20 companies from the 25 largest FTSE 250
companies by market capitalisation (excluding financial companies). No changes were made to the fees payable to Jeff Harris and 
Ken Clarke. The basic fees payable to the other non-executive Directors were increased by  10,000 per annum with effect from
1 January 2005.
Non-executive Directors derive no other benefits from their office and are not eligible to participate in the Group's pension
arrangements. Jeff Harris receives a pension in respect of his service whilst acting as an executive of the Company. It is Company policy
not to grant share options to non-executive Directors or to require part of their fees to be paid in the form of shares. Jeff Harris is
eligible to receive share options in connection with the 2002 allocation made under the long-term incentive plan when he was an
executive Director. He will be entitled to 25% of the award and will have six months to exercise the award.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for fixed terms, normally of three years. Non-executive Directors who have served beyond six
years are subject to a more rigorous review when they come up for re-election. This review takes account of the need for progressive
refreshing of the Board. The initial appointment date and the date of last re-appointment at an AGM for the non-executive Directors
are as follows:

Long-term incentive plan
The long-term incentive plan is a discretionary arrangement under which allocations are made to executive Directors with the aim of
rewarding them for creating shareholder value. Each allocation takes the form of a non-binding statement of intent to make an
award of a stated maximum amount following the end of a specified performance period. The allocation is determined as a
percentage of basic salary in the year that the performance period starts. The Directors' allocations outstanding at 24 February 2005 are:
2002 allocation 2003 allocation 2004 allocation 2005 allocation
maximum amount maximum amount maximum amount maximum amount

(1) Ian Meakins received a 2004 allocation of  400,000 on an exceptional basis to compensate him for the lost opportunity to receive financial benefit from his previous
employer. 
The performance periods for the allocations are:
2002 allocation 2003 allocation 2004 allocation 2005 allocation
Period start 1 January 2002 1 January 2003 1 January 2004 1 January 2005
Period end 31 December 2004 31 December 2005 31 December 2006 31 December 2007
The amount of the award is dependent on the achievement of certain performance measures during the performance period that the
Committee believe are the most appropriate measure of the underlying performance of the Group. Total shareholder return measures
the total return to shareholders in terms of share price growth and dividends reinvested in the shares of the Company over the
performance period. Inbucon Group provides the committee with a total shareholder return monitoring report and advises on
performance under the long-term incentive plan based on earnings per share performance. Earnings per share are defined as diluted
earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items for a full accounting year. RPI-x is the index of retail
prices for all items excluding mortgage payments as published by the UK Government. The performance against RPI-x is calculated on
a per annum compound basis.
48 Alliance UniChem Plc 49 Alliance UniChem Plc
For the 2002 allocation, the total shareholder return measure is compared with the performance of companies in the FTSE 250.
Performance measure Achievement % awarded
Total shareholder return below median -
at median (50th percentile) 12.5%
for every 1 percentile above median +1.5%
up to upper quartile (75th percentile) 50.0%
Earnings per share below RPI-x +3% -
at RPI-x +3% 5.0%
for every 0.1% above RPI-x +3% +4.5%
up to RPI-x +4% 50.0%
For the 2003, 2004 and 2005 allocations, the total shareholder return measure is compared with the performance of companies in the
FTSE 100. For the 2003 and 2004 allocations, the EPS targets are:
Performance measure Achievement % awarded
Earnings per share below RPI-x +5% -
at RPI-x +5% 5.0%
for every 0.1% above RPI-x +5% +4.5%
up to RPI-x +6% 50.0%
To bring the level of awards into line with market practice, the committee has raised the 2005 allocation to 100% of basic salary. 
The committee considers that the 2004 TSR targets for vesting remain challenging. The EPS targets were raised in 2003. 
The committee has agreed to leave the target at which awards begin to vest at RPI-x +5% p.a. but increase the target at which 
the full EPS element vests from RPI-x +6% to RPI-x +7% p.a. Given that EPS growth for the 2005 allocation will be measured in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards which may affect EPS growth, the Committee considers that the EPS
targets it has set are challenging for the 2005 allocations.
The award takes the form of a right to acquire ordinary shares in the Company for a nominal sum within a period of ten years from
the date of the award. The number of shares will be determined by the market price of the Company's shares at the date of the
award. The committee has the discretion to withhold or reduce awards to any extent it considers appropriate, having regard to the
Group's underlying financial performance and irrespective of the level of attainment of the performance targets. Board report on remuneration
During 2004, awards were made on allocations with the performance period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003. During the
performance period, the Company was in the 63rd percentile of the comparator group on total shareholder return and the increase in
earnings per share was in excess of RPI-x +4%. On this basis, awards equivalent to 82% of the allocations were made and converted
into share options at 562 pence per share, with the exception of Jeff Harris who was only entitled to 41% of the allocation, reflecting
his period as an executive Director.

The awards are further detailed in the table of share options and long-term incentive awards. 
Following the end of the performance period for the 2002 allocation detailed above, the committee has recommended to the trustees
of the 1992 Employee Trust that awards equivalent to 86.8% of the allocation are made. Their basis for doing this is that during the
performance period, the Company was in the 66.2 percentile of the comparator group on shareholder return and the increase in
earnings per share was in excess of RPI-x +4%.

Share option schemes
In addition to the long-term incentive plan, the Company operates two discretionary and one savings related share option scheme,
which are open to executive Directors as well as certain other employees. Details of outstanding options under these schemes are
shown in note 23 to the financial statements. 
Options granted under the discretionary 1997 Share Option Scheme since May 2003 have no retesting of performance measures and
have a fixed performance period being a defined three year period made up of three consecutive accounting periods. This period
commences on 1 January of the year of the award. The performance target is that the earnings per share growth of the Company
must be greater than the increase of RPI-x +4% compound over the performance period. Earnings per share are defined as the diluted
earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items over the defined accounting periods. RPI-x is defined
as the index of retail prices for all items excluding mortgage payments as published by the UK Government.
For options granted prior to May 2003 there is retesting of the performance measures where the earnings per share growth of the
Company must be greater than the increase of RPI-x +4% compound at any time during the exercise period. Earnings per share are
defined as the diluted earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items over the defined accounting
periods. RPI-x is defined as the index of retail prices for all items excluding mortgage payments as published by the UK Government.
The performance conditions for options granted up to and including 2001 have been satisfied.
There are now no outstanding options under the discretionary Executive Share Option Scheme 1990 and no further awards will be
made under this Scheme.

Ian Meakins - share incentive plan
In order to recruit Ian Meakins, it was necessary to compensate him for the loss of potential long-term incentive benefits from his
previous employer. In accordance with his service agreement, he was granted an option to acquire 119,946 shares in the Company 
(for  1 in total) on 17 December 2004 (the Initial Award ). The shares comprising the Initial Award, which are held by the Alliance
UniChem Employee Share Trust, are exercisable from 1 December 2005 to 1 December 2014. The Company will pay Ian Meakins
annually the equivalent of the total gross dividend on these shares until they are exercised. If Ian Meakins resigns, or his contract is
terminated by the Company for gross misconduct before 1 December 2005, the Initial Award will lapse and he will lose any right to
the shares included in that award. If before 1 December 2005, he ceases to be employed by the Company for any other reason,
including change of control, then the Initial Award will become exercisable on termination of his employment.

In accordance with his service agreement, Ian Meakins will also be granted a further option to acquire 153,571 shares in the Company
(for  1 in total) at the end of March 2008 (the Matching Award ), matching the 119,946 shares of the Initial Award plus a personal
investment of 33,625 shares which he purchased on 17 December 2004. The entitlement to receive all or any percentage of the
Matching Award is subject to the performance conditions set out below:
  not selling or disposing the shares comprised in the Initial Award at any time before the end of the Performance Period; 
  maintaining the personal investment of 33,625 shares in the Company; and
  remaining employed by the Company during the entire Performance Period.
The percentage of the Matching Award that Ian Meakins will receive is also subject to the performance condition described in the
table below.

Jeff Harris receives an unreduced pension from age 55, based on arrangements entered into with the Company in 1992. The agreed
pension arising was calculated on the basis of the annual rate of basic salary at the time of retirement plus the annual average of
car/fuel benefit and bonus over the preceding three years.  20,000 per annum of this pension is unfunded and is paid directly by 
the Company. 
Ian Meakins has no pension benefit, but receives a cash payment for long-term financial provision at the rate of  240,000 per annum.
This payment is disclosed under salary supplements in the emoluments table. Stefano Pessina has no pension benefits. Although he
remains eligible, Per Utnegaard's membership of the Company's pension scheme is still under discussion.
George Fairweather, Steve Duncan and Geoff Cooper are members of the defined benefit section of the Company's pension scheme. 
The benefits of the pension scheme, subject to statutory limits (including the earnings cap), are as follows:
  normal retirement age of 60;
  contributions are at the rate of 5% of basic salary; 
  a lump sum of 4 x basic salary and a spouse's pension of 50% of prospective member's pension are payable on death in service;
  the statutory minimum pension and accumulated contributions are payable on death after leaving service but before retirement;
  all pensions in payment increase in line with the Scheme Rules; and
  no allowance is made for any discretionary increases within transfer values.
In addition, George Fairweather and Geoff Cooper are members of the Alliance UniChem 1993 Pension Scheme, which is a funded
unapproved retirement benefit scheme. This is a money purchase arrangement which aims to provide limited targeted benefits on
basic salary in excess of the earnings cap. 
Ornella Barra is a member of the unapproved International Pension Scheme, which is a defined contribution arrangement.
The Company is to undertake a review of the funding of the two unapproved pension schemes during 2005.
