Directors' Remuneration Report
Introduction
This report is prepared in pounds sterling as the Company is headquartered in England and the Directors are predominantly paid in that 
currency.
The report describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors' remuneration.
The Board has prepared this report in accordance with the requirements of the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. An 
Ordinary Resolution to approve this report will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, but the Directors' 
remuneration is not conditional upon the resolution being passed. The report has been divided into separate sections for audited and 
unaudited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Sir Malcolm Field and the other members are Peter Hambro and Sir Roderic Lyne. 
 
None of the members of the Remuneration Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as Shareholders) or day-to-day 
involvement in running the business. The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the review of the performance of the Executive Directors. The remuneration and conditions 
of employment of Executive Directors and senior Executives are determined by the Remuneration Committee. Directors abstain from 
decisions determining their own remuneration. The Remuneration Committee works with the Chief Executive on all aspects of remuneration 
and sets the remuneration of the Chief Executive. The scale and structure of the Executive Directors' remuneration is approved on the basis 
of their performance, the performance of the Company and their service agreements with due regard to the interests of the Shareholders 
and the Company as a whole. The Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to the Board concerning employee incentives. 
Bearing in mind the provisions of the Combined Code, the Remuneration Committee is required to review at least annually the remuneration 
package (comprising base salary, any performance-related element of salary or bonus, participation in share option schemes and other 
benefits) of each Executive Director as proposed by the Chief Executive or previously agreed by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee is required, at least once a year, to review its own performance, constitution and terms of reference to ensure 
it is operating at maximum effectiveness and recommend any changes it considers necessary to the Board.
Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors
The Group operates in a highly competitive market place for senior skilled management which places a strong emphasis on above average 
rewards for outstanding performance. An overriding objective is to ensure that the approach to remuneration is simple and clear.
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre needed to develop and run 
the Group's businesses and to reward them for enhancing value to Shareholders. The performance measurement of the Executive Directors 
and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
As a result, the Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance-
related. As described below, Executive Directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 100% of their basic salary together with the 
benefits of long term share option incentives.
The basis of the Company's remuneration policy is that the remuneration is decided annually by the Remuneration Committee and varies 
accordingly.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management:
basic annual salary;
benefits-in-kind;
performance based bonus payments;
share option incentives; and
pension arrangements.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company providing that the Chairman's permission is obtained in 
advance of any such appointment. Jay Hambro is also a Non-Executive Director of Peter Hambro Mining plc and received an annual fee of 
 61,000 for the year ended 31 December 2007.

Basic Salary
Each Executive Director's basic salary is reviewed by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position 
or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research which gives  
up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies. Basic salaries were reviewed in February 2007 with increases taking effect from 
1 January 2007. Executive Directors' contracts of service will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Benefits-in-Kind
The Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, for example car allowance and private medical insurance.
Annual Bonus Payments
The Committee establishes specific objectives that must be met for each financial year if a performance-related bonus is to be paid; the 
objectives for 2007 are shown below. The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the 
Company's Shareholders. Account is also taken of the relative success of the different parts of the business for which the Executive Directors are 
responsible and the extent to which the strategic objectives set by the Board are being met. The maximum performance-related bonus that can 
be paid is 100% of basic annual salary. In exceptional circumstances specifically described, the Remuneration Committee can award bonuses 
above 100% of annual salary. Incentive payments for the year ended 31 December 2007 varied between 44% and 134% of basic salary. 
The objectives for Executive Directors for 2007 covered securing the assets of key projects such as K&S, Garinskoye, progressing the 
arrangements with Chinalco for the development of titanium sponge and the successful preparation for production at Kuranakh. In addition 
key management objectives have been put in place for the operational development and delivery of these projects. Bonuses were awarded 
for these achievements.
Share Options
During the year ended 31 December 2003, following approval at the Annual General Meeting, the Company established a share option 
scheme (the  Share Option Scheme'). The reason for the scheme was to incentivise the Executive Directors. The Committee had responsibility 
for supervising the scheme and the grant of options under its terms.
There were no performance criteria to be met as it was considered that the share price performance was the best indicator of performance of the 
Executive Directors and the options granted could be exercised after a period of three years from the date the option was granted. Thereafter the 
option could be exercised for the rest of its life without further test, normally provided the grantee is still in employment with the Company.
The exercise price of the options granted under the above scheme would be equal to the market value of the Company's shares at the time 
when the options were granted. 
The Company's policy has been to grant options to Directors at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual 
performance normally up to a maximum of two times annual salary. It has been the Company's policy to phase the granting of share options 
rather than to award them in a single large block to any individual other than on commencement of employment.
No amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director to share options. 
No further options over ordinary shares will be granted under the Company's existing share option scheme following the establishment of 
the Long Term Incentive Plan (see below).
Long Term Incentive Plan 
During the year ended 31 December 2007, the Company established a Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP') to operate in conjunction with an 
Employee Benefit Trust ( EBT') to provide an effective and flexible means of holding assets for the benefit of employees and their families 
and providing valuable long-term benefits. Contributions to the EBT will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, which will also 
recommend allocations under the LTIP. The EBT is administered and operated by a third party trustee. 
The potential beneficiaries of the LTIP include a number of the Executive Directors (see table below) and also some senior managers within 
the Group.
The LTIP will have a qualification period of three years and a number of embedded objectives will need to be fulfilled for the LTIP to vest. 
These objectives, which apply to all Directors, relate to: 
Production and profitability targets at the Kuranakh project; 
Maintenance of health and safety standards; 
Development targets at the Group's other key projects; and 
Further successful expansion to the portfolio of assets. 
The Remuneration Committee has provided a weighting system for these performance objectives to enforce the importance and timing of 
each and will advise the trustees of the EBT on the completion of the LTIP and have the ability to make recommendations to alter the 
objectives should they become inappropriate.

Corporate Governance
Long Term Incentive Plan continued
The Group has provided an interest free loan to the EBT enabling the trustees of the EBT to subscribe for ordinary shares in Aricom at market 
value. These shares are held by the EBT on behalf of the potential participants for the vesting period and, should the Remuneration 
Committee advise the Trustees that the LTIP objectives have been successfully achieved, the shares will be sold, the loan repaid and the 
gains on the shares passed to the participants. The allocations made under the LTIP are disclosed on page 54.
 
The following rules have been set for the operation of the LTIP: 
 
The maximum number of ordinary shares that may be allocated under the LTIP shall not exceed at any time 5% of the Company's issued 
share capital; 
The number of ordinary shares which may be held in the EBT shall not at any time exceed 5% of the Company's issued share capital; 
The maximum number of ordinary shares that may be provided to an employee under the LTIP in any financial year shall be limited to 
200% of annual salary, calculated by reference to the market value of the ordinary shares at the date of allocation; 
No further options over ordinary shares will be granted under the Company's existing share option scheme; and 
Awards under the LTIP will be subject to agreed performance conditions as established by the Remuneration Committee. However, 
completion of the performance conditions can be waived by the trustees at their sole discretion, but having regard to any 
recommendations by the Remuneration Committee, in circumstances where such conditions have become either inappropriate or overly 
onerous by external circumstances. 
Pension Arrangements
Executive Directors have their own pension arrangements and are not members of a company pension scheme. 
The Company has agreed to make contributions equivalent to between 10% and 17.5% of basic salary into the personal approved pension 
schemes of the Directors and employees. Amounts paid to Directors are set out in the Schedule of Directors' Emoluments and 
Compensation on page 52.
Directors' Contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have contracts for an indefinite term providing for up to a maximum of one year's 
notice. However, it may be necessary occasionally to offer longer notice periods to new Directors. Where this arises, it is the Company's 
policy to reduce the notice period to one year within two years of appointment of the Director. The service contract of Jay Hambro, who was 
appointed a Director in 2006, provides for a notice period of twelve months. All other Executive Directors have contracts which are subject 
to either three or six months' notice by either party. 
Sir Malcolm Field, Brian Egan and Yuri Makarov are proposed for re-election at the next annual general meeting. Their notice periods, and 
those of the other Directors, are as follows: 
   
 Date of contract Notice period
Executive Directors: 
Brian Egan 10/07/2007 6 months
Jay Hambro 01/09/2006 12 months
Yuri Makarov 26/04/2004 3 months
Martin Smith     04/04/2006   6 months
Non-Executive Directors:  
Sir Malcolm Field 01/01/2007 3 months
Peter Hambro 12/12/2003 3 months
Sir Roderic Lyne 26/09/2006 3 months
Dr Pavel Maslovskiy 12/12/2003 3 months
In the event of early termination, the Directors' contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of basic salary for the notice period. No 
compensation will be payable when a Director's appointment is terminated for reasons of unsatisfactory performance.
Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board and based on independent 
surveys of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of similar companies. In February 2007, the basic fee paid to each Non-Executive Director in the 
year was set at  30,000. The Non-Executive Directors receive further fees for additional work performed for the Company in respect of 
membership of the Remuneration Committee, Nomination Committee, Health, Safety and Environmental Committee and Audit Committee.  
The additional fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are at a rate of  10,000 for membership of a committee and  5,000 for chairmanship of a 
committee. The Chairman of the Company is paid a further  65,000 and the Senior Non-Executive Director a further  15,000. Non-Executive 
Directors were not able to participate in the Company's share option scheme with the exception of options granted at the initial listing of the 
Company on AIM.
