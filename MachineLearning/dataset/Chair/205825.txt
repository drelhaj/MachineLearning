 4 annual report 2007
Results and dividend
2007 has been another successful year for
Umeco, with significant progress across both
the Composites and Supply Chain business
streams. Indeed, were it not for certain
external factors, including the delay in the
launch of the A380 and adverse exchange
rate movements, our overall performance
would have been stronger still. 
Revenue in the year to 31 March 2007 
was  333.9 million (2006:  293.2 million),
an increase of  40.7 million of which  5.7
million relates to acquisitions. The underlying
increase in revenue was 7.7 per cent or
8.9 per cent at constant exchange rates.
Operating profits in the period rose by 
19.5 per cent to  25.7 million (2006: 
 21.5 million) with margins improving 
to 7.7 per cent (2006: 7.3 per cent).
Net financial expense, excluding
revaluations of financial instruments, 
was  3.2 million (2006:  3.4 million). 
Profit before tax was  22.5 million
(2006:  18.1 million) an increase of 24.3 per
cent. Earnings per share were 32.2 pence
(2006: 30.9 pence) and reflect the higher
number of shares in issue following the
rights issue in December 2005.
The Directors are proposing an increased 
final dividend of 10.0 pence (2006: 9.5 pence),
making a total for the year of 15.5 pence per
ordinary share (2006: 14.5 pence) an increase
of 6.9 per cent. The final dividend is payable
on 3 August 2007 to shareholders on the
register on 6 July 2007.

retain a clear competitive edge. 
Over the last decade we have achieved
compound annual growth in revenue
of 23.8 per cent, 21.3 per cent in
operating profits and 11.9 per cent

believe that, by continuing with

Group strategy
Over the past ten years, since Clive Snowdon
and I were appointed Chief Executive and
Chairman respectively, the Board has
developed and implemented a focussed
strategy . This has established Umeco as a
leading international provider of supply
chain and repair & overhaul services and
advanced composite materials primarily
to the aerospace & defence, automotive 
and wind energy markets. Evidence of the
successful execution of this strategy can 
be seen in the:
  winning of major long term supply
chain contracts, principally with
leading aerospace OEMs and airlines,
and the subsequent extension of these
relationships through the addition of a
broader range of products and services;
  carefully targeted acquisitions which
have extended both our geographic
coverage and our product and service
offerings;
  investment in our businesses to
ensure they have the capacity and
operating efficiency to provide the
highest levels of customer service; and

Chairman's Statement
Strategic developments in the year
Contracts
Umeco Components, now renamed Umeco
Supply Chain, was successful in winning two
major new contracts in the second half of the
year, with Thales Aerospace and Turbomeca.
Management are now fully engaged in the
implementation of both programmes
following the recent opening of a new facility 
close to Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.
Acquisitions
During the year we made three bolt-on
acquisitions. In June 2006, Advanced
Composites Group (  ACG') acquired
Aerodyne Advanced Composites, based in
Cape Town, South Africa. Aerodyne, which
now trades under the ACG brand, has a
long term contract to manufacture chassis
parts for the Mercedes McLaren SLR super
car, utilising composite materials
exclusively supplied by Umeco.
In October 2006, Antavia, a Toulouse-based
repair & overhaul company, was acquired
and has been successfully integrated 
into the Group's Repair & Overhaul
business stream.
In November 2006, Aeropia, a Umeco
Composites company, acquired the assets
and business of US Airmotive, a Miami-
based distributor of aerospace chemicals,
and has subsequently merged 
it with its US subsidiary.
Capital investments
In September 2006, ACG opened its new 
UK technology centre, manufacturing and
 A FOCUS ON PRODUCT AND SERVICE
INNOVATION ENSURES THAT, WITHIN OUR
SELECTED MARKET SEGMENTS, WE RETAIN
A CLEAR COMPETITIVE EDGE 
With ever-rising energy prices and industry's increasing
appetite for more environmentally sustainable solutions,
demand for the Group's advanced composite materials,
from a growing number of industries, is expected to
continue to increase at a high rate in the coming years

warehousing facility to much acclaim by
customers, suppliers and employees. At a
capital cost of  7.0 million this investment
places ACG at the forefront of its industry
and adds much needed capacity for the
medium term.
Later in the year, Umeco Supply Chain
signed contracts to acquire a freehold site
and build a new, much larger facility in
Derby to further support our long term
contracts and in particular our growing
relationships with Rolls-Royce plc and
Goodrich Actuation Systems. This new
facility is scheduled to come on stream 
in the autumn of 2007.
Directors
At the Annual General Meeting in July 2006
John Harper retired as a non-executive
Director after over eleven years' valuable
service to Umeco. To replace John, Stephen
Bird, a divisional director of the Weir Group,
was appointed in October 2006.
Michael Harper is standing down as a
non-executive Director at the 2007 Annual
General Meeting due to his other business
commitments.  We thank Michael for his
contribution since joining the Board in 2002.
I am very pleased that Chris Hole, who was
Director of Procurement at Rolls-Royce plc
and retired in December 2006, will be
joining the Board as a non-executive
Director on 25 July 2007.
Management and employees
Alan Moore, Managing Director of ACG,
has retired after many successful years
with the company and has been replaced
by Jon Mabbitt who was previously ACG's
UK Operations Director. 
As Umeco continues to grow and develop
we are able to engage an increasing
number of talented individuals who are
attracted by our entrepreneurial culture
and decentralised management structure.
Our on-going success is a testament to
the dedication and hard work of our
growing workforce, which now numbers
over 1,600, based in all the regions of
the world.
Prospects
In the year under review we enjoyed a
high level of underlying growth in revenue
and profits, despite the impact of a
number of external factors including the
production delay of the A380 and a
weakening US dollar.
Looking forward, the principal market in
which Umeco operates, civil aerospace,
looks robust with Airbus and Boeing
entering 2007 with record order books.
Airbus has indicated that A380 production
will restart during our second half year
and Boeing's development of the B787
appears to be on schedule, with a first
flight expected this Autumn and initial
deliveries due in mid-2008. Both of these
significant programmes are anticipated
to generate a high level of incremental
revenue for the Group.
In addition, the use of advanced composite
materials in our principal growth markets
of aerospace, automotive, motor sport
and wind energy continues to grow at
a high rate; this should lead to an
increasing utilisation of our recently
extended capacity.
These factors, coupled with recent
acquisitions and contract wins, place
Umeco on track for another year of strong
performance. We have the management
team and financial resources in place to
support our ambitious plans and the
resolve to work through the external
factors that arise from time to time.
In summary, we go into in the new
financial year with a record order book,
rising demand from the markets in 
which we operate and a much enhanced
infrastructure, following the major
investments we have made over the last
three years. We are therefore looking
forward to another successful year for
the Group.
