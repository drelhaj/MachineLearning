INVESTING
FOR GROWTH
In our 2005 Annual Report and Accounts we stated that the group was
Focused for Growth . We are pleased to report an increase in our revenue
of 7% in 2006, which has been delivered by a combination of organic growth 
of 2% and targeted acquisitions.
The Permaclean acquisition, completed in January 2007, marks an important 
first step in our ambition to achieve a national workwear business of real scale 
in Germany. We expect that our acquisitions, which totalled  96 million in 2006
and 2007 to date, will deliver good returns once they are fully integrated into 
the business.
There is positive momentum in most of our markets in Continental Europe, 
where profits increased ahead of revenues and our operating margin was 16.3%
(2005: 16.1%). The UK continued to face the more significant challenge from
increased costs and difficulties in obtaining matching price increases, but the
expected benefit from acquisitions was delivered in the second half of 2006. 
Overall the group traded in line with our expectations in 2006.

Results overview
Revenue from continuing operations in the year was  704.6 million (2005: 
 655.7 million) and operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of
customer contracts and intellectual property rights (adjusted operating profit) was
 94.9 million compared with  92.4 million last year, an increase of 3%. Overall,
our adjusted return on sales for the group was 13.5% compared with 14.1% last
year. Our net finance expense was  9.6 million compared with  7.2 million last
year, reflecting both interest rate rises and the additional funding required for 
the investments we have made. Our adjusted earnings per share rose 11% to 
35.7 pence from 32.1 pence last year helped by a small decrease in the effective tax
rate from 28.8% to 28.3%, and taking into account the 2005 share consolidation.
During the period we realised exceptional income totalling  2.8 million, which
primarily related to the further receipt of cash from the sale of the HSS business.
Amortisation of acquired customer contracts and intellectual property rights
amounted to  6.1 million compared with  1.8 million last year, due to the full year
effect of the 2005 and 2006 acquisitions. Operating profit after these items was
 91.6 million ( 88.8 million). The sale of our business in France is treated as a
discontinued operation for both 2006 and 2005. The business reported a loss after
tax of  0.3 million ( 0.9 million) prior to sale and the loss on sale was  2.7 million.
Total earnings per share were 32.4 pence compared with 66.8 pence in 2005, 
which included the profit on the sale of Elliott.
Free cash flow of  60.0 million was generated in the year ( 62.8 million) for 
the continuing business. As planned, we increased our capital expenditure to
 144.6 million ( 136.7 million) as we invested in new plants in the growing markets
of Norway and Poland and in textiles to support our new contracts. The free cash
flow conversion of the adjusted profit for the continuing business for the year was
therefore 99% compared with 103% last year. Net borrowings at 31st December
2006 were  237.2 million compared with  214.2 million at 31st December 2005,
following cash investments of  40.4 million for acquisitions in 2006.
The board is recommending a final dividend of 12.4 pence, which together with
the interim dividend of 5.8 pence paid in October 2006, gives a total of 18.2 pence,
an increase of 5% on last year. The total dividend is covered two times by the
adjusted earnings per share.
Strategy summary and achievements
Our core strategy is to build leading market positions in textile maintenance from
which to deliver revenue growth both organically and by making acquisitions. 
These acquisitions are either bolt-on to our existing scale businesses or are
investments in expanding markets within our core area of expertise. We focus 
on managing our operations efficiently to ensure our growth in revenues delivers
sustainable profit growth, stable cash flows and higher levels of return to
shareholders. Geographically we remain focused on Europe.
In 2006, we have continued to invest to broaden the reach of our existing business
through bolt-on acquisitions but also to expand our platform for future growth. 
In December 2006, we agreed to acquire the Permaclean Group in Germany,
which completed in January 2007. The Permaclean acquisition is an important
step in establishing a workwear business in Germany on a national scale in line
with our stated strategy. In the UK we have invested in an improved production
network and direct sales opportunities to complement our existing service areas.
We continue to review areas for further expansion.
Geographical expansion, particularly into Central Europe, remains an important 
area of development. In 2006, we spent a significant amount of time looking 
at the opportunities for market entry through acquisition into the Czech 
Republic but we have not yet been able to find companies of the right profile. 
We are reviewing our strategy for entry into that market as well as continuing 
to look at other markets in Central Europe.
We are investing in new plants where we see the opportunity for more significant
growth. In 2006, we made further investment in plants in Poland and in Norway
and also in our existing workwear business in Germany. At the same time we have
divested businesses where we see limited growth opportunities. In 2006, we sold our
small business in France, which was serving hotels and restaurants from a single plant
in Paris, as well as our last remaining flat linen plant in Lillehammer, which leaves our
Norwegian business now focused on higher margin workwear, mats and washrooms.

Board and management
There were no changes to the board during 2006. In early February 2007 we
announced that Ren  Schuster would join the board as a Non-Executive from 
1st March 2007. Details of Ren s background are included on page 27 and we 
are confident that he will be a valuable contributor to the board's deliberations.
We were disappointed to receive the resignation, in January 2007, of Christer
Str m, the Managing Director of our Continental European business, who is leaving
to take up a major international appointment. Christer has worked for Berendsen 
since 2001 and has been Managing Director since January 2005. He remains with
us until June and the process to appoint his successor is under way. The existing
management team continue actively to follow the agreed growth strategy.
Steve Finch, the Managing Director in the UK, and his team have succeeded in
delivering a good result in the very challenging UK market where they have seen
competitors exiting and their operational excellence has contributed greatly to 
the year's performance.
We have experienced national management teams in each of the countries 
where we operate. They and their staff fully support our growth strategy and 
their commitment and hard work during the year has been a major contribution 
to the group results in 2006. We thank them all on behalf of the board and 
our shareholders.
Other financial matters
In May 2006 we concluded a private placement transaction to provide the group
with additional sources of financing, to extend the term of the committed funding
and to increase the level of fixed borrowings. The private placement was with US
institutions for $250 million at attractive rates, which we swapped principally into
fixed euro, Danish krone and Swedish krona borrowings. We used these, to repay
amounts drawn under our Revolving Credit Facility, which remains at  420 million.
In the same month we completed our B share programme by repurchasing the
remaining shares for  6.5 million. In May and June 2006 we purchased 825,000
Davis shares in the market for a total cost of  3.6 million and hold them as 
treasury shares.
In December 2006 we made a payment of  12.5 million into the group' s main UK
Pension Plan to fund the past service deficit which, when added to the  5 million
funding made earlier in the year, totalled  17.5 million for 2006. The deficit on 
this UK plan was  25.3 million at 31 December 2006 before we made a further
payment into the plan of  12.5 million in January 2007. Our balance sheet remains
strong with gearing of 60% at 31 December 2006 (57%). T aking account of the
January 2007 pension funding and our acquisitions in 2007 the pro forma gearing is
77%. The financing of the Permaclean acquisition was made from drawings under
the revolving credit facility in January 2007. We have increased the proportion of
borrowings at fixed rates by entering into two further five year swap agreements
for a total of 155 million ( 37 million) in January 2007 at a rate of 4.4% and our
gross fixed borrowings now amount to  252 million (65% of total borrowings) 
at an average annual rate of 4.1%. This is in line with the group's policy of
maintaining at least 50% of gross borrowings at fixed rates. Our interest was
covered 10 times by operating profits in 2006 (13 times).
Our post tax return on invested capital was 8.4%, up from 8.2% last year.
Outlook
On the Continent, we expect further progress through organic growth, the benefit
of bolt-on acquisitions and the expansion of our workwear business in Germany
through the Permaclean acquisition.
In the UK, while we see no significant overall easing in the difficult market conditions
as yet, we will continue with tight operational management and expect increased
contributions from acquisitions.
Overall we expect to deliver a satisfactory outcome for 2007.
