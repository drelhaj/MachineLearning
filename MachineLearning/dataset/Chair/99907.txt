Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Despite the weakening trading conditions
in many markets around the world,we
are pleased to report results for 2008 in
line with our expectations,reflecting the
progress we have made against our
growth strategy and the benefits of
excellent portfolio diversification.
Performance
Group sales have increased by 3.4% to
 6.3bn for the full year to 31 December
2008,benefiting from strategic and focused
acquisitions and from organic sales growth
in most of our markets.On a like for like,
constant currency basis,sales fell by 4.3%
reflecting the impact of an unprecedented
and rapid downturn that started to affect
our industry in the second half of 2008.
Profit before tax and exceptional items of
 190.7m was 18.9% lower than 2007 and
adjusted earnings per share fell 18.9% to
30p.On a statutory basis,which includes
exceptional items,profit before tax of
 108.2m was 54.9% below 2007 and
earnings per share fell 70.5% to 11.2p.
We responded swiftly to the market decline
by reducing our cost base,closing 24 less
profitable sites,reducing our workforce by
more than 2,000 people and implementing
other restructuring measures which are
expected to generate an annualised saving
of approximately  58m at 2009 exchange
rates.These actions have resulted in an
exceptional charge in 2008 of  28.3m
together with a charge of  54.2m for
goodwill impairment largely due to the
downturn in Latvia.
When reviewing the performance of
our business units,trading profit is a key
measure and is defined as operating profit
excluding the impact of exceptional items
and unallocated central costs.
In our Distribution businesses we grew
sales by 5.8% despite challenging trading
conditions.We primarily benefited from
strong performances in Singapore,where
we outperformed the market with new
model launches and strong commercial
vehicle sales resulting in a trading profit
growth of 23.9%,in Hong Kong with a
trading profit growth of 17.7% and in the
Rest of World with trading profit growth
of 23.2%.We retained market share as well
as market leadership in Greece and sales
in Belgium grew 0.2% on 2007 under very
difficult conditions.In Australia,whilst new
models helped to improve market share
by 10bp,the market decline resulted in a
trading profit decrease of 3.7%.The UK fleet
management business,Inchcape Fleet
Solutions,suffered from a residual value
provision increase of  8.5m.

Inchcape has a proven
and resilient business
model.The industry
faces an unprecedented
downturn but we will
remain solid by focusing
on our core activities.

Shareholder information
Inside back cover
Sales in our Retail businesses grew by 1.6%
in 2008,benefiting from our acquisitions in
Russia,9.3% growth in Australia and a new
Lexus retail centre in China.Across Europe,
sales grew 3.0% as a result of strong
performance in Greece and Finland.In the
UK we outperformed the market with like for
like sales falling 5.4% in a market which fell
11.3%.In the Russia and Emerging Markets
segment,trading profits increased by 40.9%
largely as a result of our acquisitions in
Russia and growth in Poland.
Acquisition and disposal summary
We made further progress in our UK disposal
programme in accordance with our strategy
to streamline the business following the
acquisition of European Motor Holdings plc in
2007.We sold our Vauxhall business and the
majority of our Volvo retail outlets for a total
consideration of  17.0m.These transactions
followed the disposals of Inchcape
Automotive,Wilcomatic,and the Bentley,
Ferrari and Maserati retail outlets in 2007.
We have reinvested the proceeds from
these disposals into our Russia and Emerging
Markets segment,announcing in March the
acquisition of the remaining 24.9% stake in
our St Petersburg business for a total cash
consideration of  28.5m.This gave the Group
full ownership of its operations in St Petersburg
and was another step in the implementation
of the Group's multi-brand Retail footprint,
providing broad segment coverage in what
is expected to be one of the fastest growing
markets in the world.
In April,we announced further expansion in
this market with the acquisition of an initial
75.1% shareholding in Musa Motors group,
one of Russia's largest car retailing groups,
giving Inchcape a significant scale position
in Moscow through 16 sites with key global
brand partners.The initial consideration
was  100.3m (see note 27 for details).This
acquisition has positioned Inchcape with
one of the largest networks of premium
brands in Moscow.
In May we announced another landmark
in our expansion into the Chinese market
with the official opening of our wholly
owned Lexus retail centre in Shaoxing.
During the year we also sold our French
operation to its management team for a
consideration of  7.6m.
Dividend
The Board is not recommending the
payment of a final ordinary dividend for the
year in light of the current deterioration of
trading conditions (2007 - 10.5p).The Board
recommended a half year dividend for 2008
of 5.46p which reflected a 4.0% increase on
the half year 2007 dividend.
We currently do not expect to recommend
any dividend for the financial year ending
31 December 2009.
We intend to return to our stated aim of
maintaining a progressive dividend policy
as soon as trading conditions allow.
Share buy back
The Group purchased  16.0m of its shares
in 2008 through the acquisition of 4.5m
shares,now held as Treasury shares at
an average price of  3.59 per share.
Approach to governance and
management
We continue to focus on the importance
of good governance and observe the
Combined Code and other relevant
guidance for listed companies in our global
operations.Integrating socially responsible
behaviour into every aspect of how we
operate and define ourselves remains high
on our agenda.In 2008 we have built on
the foundations of a global approach to
Corporate Responsibility (CR) that is making
responsible economic,environmental and
social behaviour intrinsic to the way we work.
People
Our people strategy is to have engaged
people in winning teams,creating the
ultimate customer experience for our brand
partners.On behalf of the Board,I wish to
express thanks to our colleagues across the
Group for their commitment and spirit in
delivering these results for 2008.
I would like to make special mention of William
Tsui,Chairman of Inchcape Asia-Pacific who
sadly passed away in February 2009,after 18
years with the Group.Under his leadership,our
businesses in Hong Kong,Macau,Singapore,
Brunei,Guam and Saipan consolidated their
market leading positions.Latterly William
spearheaded our entry into China.William
will be remembered for his passion for the
motor industry and our customers and for
his truly inspirational leadership.
Strengthening our capital structure
The Group has historically maintained what
was considered to be an appropriate level
of borrowings given the prevailing economic
environment.Given the prospect of a difficult
trading environment in 2009 and beyond,
we intend to continue our actions to reduce
net debt.In order to further strengthen the
position of the Group,the Board believes it
is both appropriate and in the best interests
of its shareholders to raise net proceeds
of approximately  232m in equity via a
Rights Issue which we announced on
19 March 2009.
We intend to use the net proceeds
of this Rights Issue to reduce the level
of indebtedness which in the short term
will increase headroom and delay the
refinancing of existing facilities.In the longer
term,we expect that strengthening the
Group's balance sheet through this
Rights Issue together with the action
we have taken to lower our cost base,
our geographic spread and diversified
revenue streams,will better position us
to take advantage of market recovery.
Outlook
Although the Group expects trading
conditions to remain extremely challenging
throughout 2009 and the actual results for
January and February were well below last
year,they have exceeded management's
expectations in difficult markets,due to a
good start to the year in Singapore and
a stabilisation of UK used car margins.
Currently,March order levels for the Group's
UK operations are in line with our revised
expectations.The fundamentals of the
Group remain solid and our strategic
direction is clear.We have responded
quickly and decisively to global economic
conditions.Our experienced management
teams,our track record of operational
excellence,our focus on superior customer
service and the strength of our relationships
with our brand partners give us confidence
that we will successfully weather the current
storm in our industry and emerge stronger.
Board change
As previously announced,I will be
retiring from the position of Non-executive
Chairman in May 2009,following 14 years
with the Company,six years as Group Chief
Executive and three years as Chairman.
I am delighted that Ken Hanna,who has
been a Non-executive Director of Inchcape
for six years,is to be appointed Non-executive
Chairman of the Group with effect from
14 May 2009.Ken has considerable skills
and expertise with a proven track record
both at a financial and operational level
and as a Non-executive Director,as well as
direct experience of operating businesses
in emerging and developed markets.
I have thoroughly enjoyed my years with
Inchcape,especially working with so many
talented colleagues both on the Board and
in the business and I know that I am leaving
the Group in very good hands.
