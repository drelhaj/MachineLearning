Overview
The year to 30 June 2013 has been 
one of K3's toughest and the results 
r eflec t	the	challenges	of	w eak	mar kets ,	
especially	r etail ,	and	our	sig nifican t	
programme of investment to deliver a 
major	new	M icr osof t - c er tified	D ynamics	
AX solution, Gemstone, for the retail 
mar ket.	 W e	r emain	v er y	ex cit ed	about	
the sales potential of Gemstone, both

par ticular , 	 ha ving 	 made 	 the 	 first 	 r elease	
of Gemstone functionality in the second 
half, we secured a number of initial 
or ders 	 with 	 some 	 high 	 pr ofile 	 r etailers	
and we now have a growing base of 
blue chip retail customers who will be 
v aluable 	 r ef er enc e 	 sit es 	 f or 	 Gemst one . 	 I n	
addition 	 t o 	 capitalised 	 c osts 	 of 	  1.45m,	
our investment in Gemstone, including 
sales, deployment and support teams, 
amounted to  2.2m over the year. We will 
be 	 mak ing 	 fur ther 	 r eleases 	 of 	 Gemst one	
functionality later in 2013, with full 
product completion expected around 
mid 	 2014. 	 T her e 	 is 	 a 	 str ong 	 pipeline 	 of	
interest and we are very encouraged 
about the opportunities. More generally, 
there are signs that retailers are returning 
to spending on technology. This is also 
illustr a t ed 	 in 	 the 	 marked 	 upturn 	 in 	 new	
wins 	 t o w ar ds 	 the 	 close 	 of 	 the 	 financial	
y ear 	 f or 	 our 	 established 	 M icr osof t 	 NA V	
retail solution. The total value of the 
major new order wins secured in the year 
across the Group was  11.56m (2012: 
 12.94m), 	 with 	 some 	 70% 	 b y 	 v alue ,	
 8.13m, signed in the second half. This 
included 	  4.2m 	 of 	 r etail 	 or ders 	 in 	 the	
f our th 	 quar t er , 	 which 	 will 	 benefit 	 the	
M icr osof t 	 UK 	 Division ' s 	 per f ormanc e 	 in	
the 	 new 	 financial 	 y ear .	
Our investment in our Managed Services 
Division 	 also 	 c on tinued 	 o v er 	 the 	 y ear	
and is now substantially concluded. 
We completed the development of our 
hosting platforms and now also offer a 
range of hosting services to cater for the 
needs of both smaller and large global 
customers. The long term opportunity 
to build substantial recurring revenues 
from this activity remains and we expect 
any upturn in demand across our other 
Divisions , 	 especially 	 M icr osof t 	 UK , 	 t o	
benefit 	 the 	 Division.	
Our	SY SPRO	and	Sage	Division	
continued to generate high levels of 
recurring income and cash, and our 
SY SPRO	ac tivities	deliv er ed	a	v er y	
encouraging performance. A new 
r elease	of	SY SPRO	and	Sage ' s	X3	pr oduc t	
should help to stimulate growth in the 
new	financial	y ear .	
A major strength of the business 
remains its high levels of recurring

Financial Results
Revenues for the year ended 30 June 
2013 	 declined 	 b y 	 7% 	 t o 	  63.51m 	 (2012:	
 67.96m), 	 lar gely 	 r eflecting 	 the 	 w eak	
per f or manc e 	 of 	 the 	 Micr osoft 	 UK 	 Division.
As expected, the Group incurred 
sig nifican t 	 pr oduc t 	 dev elopmen t	
c osts 	 this 	 financial 	 y ear , 	 which 	 t otalled	
 3.56m. A major element of this was 
Project Gemstone, within our Microsoft 
UK 	 and 	 I n t erna tional 	 Divisions , 	 but	
we also invested further across other 
product suites and in hosting in the 
Managed 	 Ser vic es 	 Division. 	 O f 	 the

hosting. We incurred additional costs 
of  2.2m in building our Gemstone 
sales, deployment and support teams in 
anticipation of demand that, late in the 
year, started to be realised.
We incurred exceptional costs of  0.73m 
in the year. This related primarily to 
restructuring of the acquisitions we 
made in prior years.

expenses reduced to  0.73m (2012:

and favourable movements in foreign 
exchange rates.
We have recognised a deferred tax credit

t ogether 	 with 	 the 	 impac t 	 of 	 lo w er 	 pr ofits
