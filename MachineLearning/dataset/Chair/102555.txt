Overview
I
am pleased to present the
results of InTechnology plc for
the year ended 31 March 2003
which show a strong performance
in a challenging market for IT
expenditure. 
Our strategy this year has been
twofold. First and foremost, our
goal has been to align the
business to manage the downturn
across the IT industry by ensuring
that we maintain our significant
market share. We have continued
to consolidate our position by
aggressively driving volumes in
our SSS Division and successfully
offering managed infrastructure
services to new customers. The
result is a robust sales
performance in SSS and
continued growth in the value of
contract wins in MDS, which now
stands in excess of  40m (2002:
 22m) and will generate  10.5m
of recurring revenue per annum
(2002:  6.9m).
A focus on costs has also been
necessary during the year to
protect margins. The closure of
our German subsidiary and better
expenditure control have enabled
us to achieve a consistent cost
level, despite our investment in
new services.
The second strand of our strategy
has been to underpin the future
success of the business through
new developments and expansion.
The first of these has been
achieved through the continued
progress with our MDS division,
as well as exciting new
developments such as our
UK-wide high bandwidth network
and our long-term data storage
proposition. As far as expansion
is concerned, the proposed
acquisition of Allasso not only
adds distribution capability across
Europe, but also introduces a new
and rapidly expanding service line
to our offering.
Trading and operating
performance
As noted in our interim financial
statement, we have not
experienced quite the same
decline in revenues felt by much
of the IT industry and believe that
we have grown our market share.
The volume of data storage
products sold continues to
increase but, on account of the
significant price erosion, we have
reported a marginal decline in
overall revenues compared to the
prior year. We continue to adopt a
rigorous approach to cost control
which has enabled us to maintain
reasonable profit margins.
Turnover for the year was
 156.9m (2002:  158.1m) and
despite the market environment,
gross profit increased to  23.3m
(2002:  22.3m). Net operating
expenses before depreciation,
amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional items remained
consistent at  19.3m (2002:
 19.4m). Total net operating
expenses were  29.8m (2002:
 104.6m). Earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation,
amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional items improved to
 3.9m (2002:  2.8m). Total
operating loss before interest and
tax was  6.6m (2002:  82.7m).
The Group reported a loss for the
financial year of  7.0m (2002:
 83.2m) resulting in a loss per
share of 5.10p (2002: 60.23p).
InTechnology's balance sheet
remains strong, with cash of
 18.2m (2002:  23.3m) and 
net cash, after finance leases 
and term loans, of  10.0m 
(2002:  13.7m). 
Executive Chairman's statement
 ... the proposed acquisition of Allasso not only adds
distribution capability across Europe, but also
introduces a new and rapidly expanding service 
line to our offering .  4
SSS Division
The mix of revenues within SSS
has changed over the last year
with growth in our HP, IBM and
Software and Service activities
offset by a decline in sales of Sun
equipment. Software and Services
revenues have continued to
increase and we will continue to
focus on growing these in the
year ahead. 
In the year, SSS has achieved
revenues of  148.7m (2002:
 154.0m) but, with reduced costs,
has reported a small decrease in
operating margins before goodwill
amortisation to 5.5% (2002:
5.7%). Operating margin after
goodwill amortisation was 4.3%
(2002: 4.6%). The Division
returned an operating profit
before goodwill amortisation of
 8.1m (2002:  8.8m). Divisional
operating profit before interest
and tax was  6.4m (2002:  7.1m).
Consultancy, maintenance and
software revenues amounted to
16.6% (2002: 12.8%) of the
Division's revenue.
MDS Division
MDS has achieved revenues of
 8.2m (2002:  4.1m), with an
operating loss before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional
items of  9.1m (2002:  9.7m),
which reflects our ongoing
investment in the division.
Divisional operating loss before
interest and tax was  13.0m
(2002:  89.4m).
The division secured a number of
high profile customer wins,
including Chrysalis, Harvey
Nichols, Numis, Cheshire Police,
The Department for Transport,
Sitel, Scottish Enterprise and
WS Atkins. Roll out and
deployment of these managed
services tends to commence some
months after the contract is won
so the financial impact of these
recurring revenues tends not to be
seen until up to six months later.
New developments
In February 2003, we introduced a
high bandwidth communications
network running through 19 of
the UK's major cities to support
MDS. This Wide Area LAN
Extension Service provides
powerful and secure connectivity
for our enterprise clients, enabling
them to backup large data
volumes on a national basis rather
than, as previously, in the London
area alone. 
Although only recently
commissioned, we are already
seeing our clients benefit from its
performance and the expanded
range of services we can now
offer them. Clients who have
adopted our managed storage
service are now also taking
internet access, hosting and pure
connectivity services from us.
This spring we launched a pilot
programme to test our managed
long-term storage proposition to
address clients' needs to securely
archive data. There is a growing
need to archive electronic records
in industry and the public sector
which is driven in part by
regulatory pressure. We continue
to anticipate that future data
storage solutions will incorporate
these features.

Operational changes
With all the indicators showing
substantial potential for
InTechnology's services, especially
among blue-chip companies, we
have undertaken two operational
changes this year which we
believe will position InTechnology
more effectively to exploit the
opportunities we see in the
storage market.
  We have grouped all of the
development, support and sales of
our Managed Services into a
single operation, accountable for
the entirety of its activities. While
MDS was in its infancy, it was
beneficial to separately manage
the development, support and
sales of these services. They are
now sufficiently robust to be run
as a single division, run by a
newly appointed executive. 
  In the interests of rigorous
cost control, we closed our
loss-making subsidiary in
Germany in October 2002. This
subsidiary was engaged purely in
the provision of managed services
where we felt that greater critical
mass and relationships were
required to ensure success. The
intended acquisition of Allasso is
expected to provide a firmer
platform for the launch of
managed services again as well as
for storage product sales. 
Allasso
In April 2003, we announced that
we had agreed to purchase the
pan-European specialist security
distributor Allasso from its parent,
Articon-Integralis. Allasso will
provide us with a platform of
some 7,000 additional resellers
across six European countries
through which we can expand our
storage sales. In the year ended
31 December 2002 Allasso
reported proforma revenues of
 152.0m ( 104.8m)
1
and EBITDA
of  10.5m ( 7.2m)
1
. EBIT was
 8.3m ( 5.7m)
1
.
The network security market,
where Allasso is strongest, is
an attractive growing market
and complementary to the
storage market as almost all new
data storage devices are linked
into networks and are in need
of security.
The acquisition is conditional
upon Articon-Integralis
shareholder approval at a general
meeting on 23 June 2003 with
anticipated completion at the end
of July 2003. 
Current trading
The first two months of this
fiscal year show no change in the
data storage market conditions
from the preceding half. The
performance of our SSS Division
in this period has started in the
same vein as at the start of last
year. Encouragingly, activity levels
in our MDS Division remain high
with a run rate of contract wins
in line with our expectations.
Outlook
Data volumes continue to grow
inexorably and organisations of all
sizes are looking for solutions to
the critical problems of data
management and storage. At the
same time, companies everywhere
are looking for ways to contain or
reduce IT spend. So, in close
partnership with vendors and our
customers, we will continue to
explore ways to provide the value
and services that clients need. 
We expect our portfolio of
managed data services (which
includes offsite backup, data
replication, hosting, network
connectivity and other
infrastructure-related services),
to become increasingly popular
among our partners as a means to
enable their clients' organisations
to outsource the network
computing elements of their IT
which are capital intensive and
time-consuming for enterprises
to manage.
