Business review:  
Chairman's statement
Stuart Wallis Chairman 
Overview
Our business continues to perform well. In the past year we added 
three programmes to help build our development pipeline, diversifying 
the risk in our pipeline without, we believe, diluting the rewards. We 
are delighted with the progress being made with each of the three 
programmes and we recently reported encouraging phase 2a data 
for OncoGel
TM
 in oesophageal cancer. 
Financial results for the year ended 31 March 2007 were slightly 
ahead of market expectations, and included a  10.0 million milestone 
payment from AstraZeneca for scale up of the CytoFab  manufacturing 
process. R&D for the year increased over the previous year, reflecting 
continued expenditure on CytoFab  and Voraxaze , a quarter's 
expenditure from the acquisition of MacroMed, and the in-licensed 
programmes for the treatment of pre-eclampsia and B-CLL.
Following our  38.2 million fundraising in January 2007, we ended 
the 2006-2007 financial year with  40.0 million in cash, up from 
 25.4 million at our last year end. Our strong cash position, together with 
our product revenues and anticipated CytoFab
TM 
milestones, provide us 
with the resources to progress our expanded pipeline.
Strategic direction
Protherics is actively building a leading international biopharmaceutical 
company. T o create a sustainable business, we believe that we must 
be able to take at least some of our own products through to market to 
retain their full economic value. We are focusing in two key areas: critical 
care and cancer. In both, targeted specialist products with high medical 
value can be developed and marketed effectively by a focused sales team. 
With the potential launch of Voraxaze  in the US in 2009, we have 
an opportunity to build a specialist sales and marketing capability 
in cancer. During this past year we have had extensive interaction 
with both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA ) 
on Voraxaze . In the US, we expect to start resubmitting our 
marketing application in early 2008 under a rolling submission, with an 
estimated approval date in 2009. To capitalise on this opportunity, 
we are building a pipeline of cancer products with high medical 
value that we can look to sell ourselves in the future. 
In 2010, the marketing rights to our two FDA-approved critical care 
products, CroFab  and DigiFab , return to Protherics, providing us 
with an opportunity to distribute these products ourselves in the US. 
Meanwhile, Protherics, together with its local partner, Beacon 
Pharmaceuticals, is preparing to market DigiFab  in Europe once 
the necessary regulatory approvals have been granted.
The opportunities to sell CroFab , DigiFab  and Voraxaze , 
together with manufacturing initiatives to improve CroFab  gross 
margins, are expected to provide the Company with additional cash 
flow from which to fund our product pipeline.
Major market opportunities
While we are seeking to develop products we can market ourselves, 
we also have three programmes targeting potential billion dollar 
markets where we have, or will require, major pharmaceutical partners: 
CytoFab  for sepsis; Digoxin Immune Fab for pre-eclampsia; and our 
Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine for high blood pressure. We expect 
to have additional phase 2 data on each of these key programmes 
over the next 12 to 24 months.
Our strong cash position, together with our product revenues and 
anticipated CytoFab
TM
 milestones, provide us with the resources 
to progress our expanded pipeline.

Heading
Protherics is the world's leading manufacturer 
of ovine polyclonal antibody fragments for 
therapeutic use. We have a track record of 
producing CroFab  (pit viper antivenom) and 
DigiFab  (digoxin overdose) for sale in the US, 
and we have scaled up the manufacturing 
process for CytoFab  (severe sepsis) to 
commercial batch size.

 30-FOLD
INCREASE IN OUR CHROMATOGRAPHIC 
PROCESSING CAPABILITY
  Scaling up 
the CytoFab  
manufacturing 
process has been 
a major focus for 
Protherics since 
signing the deal 
with AstraZeneca 
in December 2005. 
We are extremely 
pleased to have met 
this key milestone 
which allows 
AstraZeneca to start its 
phase 2 development 
programme in the 
second half of 2007.

Major market opportunities continued
CytoFab , our anti-TNF-alpha polyclonal Fab for the treatment of 
severe sepsis, remains the largest single value driver in our business. 
Under the terms of the licensing deal signed with AstraZeneca in 
December 2005, Protherics is entitled to receive up to  187.0 million 
in upfront and milestone payments together with a 20% royalty on global 
net sales of CytoFab  and additional manufacturing related supply 
payments. AstraZeneca also made a  7.5 million equity investment 
in Protherics on completion of the deal. Following the recent  10.0 million 
milestone payment from AstraZeneca, we have received a total of 
 26.3 million in upfront and milestone payments. We look forward 
to more patients being treated with CytoFab  when AstraZeneca 
begins its phase 2 programme in the second half of 2007.
We see an opportunity to sign major licensing deals for our two 
other potential blockbuster programmes, should we demonstrate 
proof of concept for Digoxin Immune Fab and Angiotensin 
Therapeutic Vaccine in 2008.
Realising value from non-core assets
Protherics has a number of non-core assets from which we 
hope to realise value in the near to mid term. In addition to 
Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine, we have a proprietary adjuvant, 
CoVaccine HT , which is attracting interest from third parties for use 
with their own vaccines, and the drug delivery platform technologies 
and programmes gained through the acquisition of MacroMed.
Board changes
Barry Riley, our Finance Director since the formation of Protherics in 
1999, will step down from his role in August 2007. Barry has played 
a vital role in the Company's development, and leaves Protherics 
in a strong financial position. I thank him for his support and wish him 
all the best for the future. Barry will be replaced by Rolf Soderstrom, 
who joins us from Cobham PLC. Rolf's operational, transactional, 
and treasury experience with much larger businesses will put us 
in good stead as we seek to grow our business.
It is also a pleasure for me to welcome Saul Komisar, President 
of our US operations, to our Board in recognition of Saul's strong 
contribution to our business over many years.
Outlook
We have an opportunity to create a pre-eminent UK biopharmaceutical 
company with international standing and the financial resources to 
fulfil its ambition. With products targeting nine different indications, 
we expect ten clinical studies to be ongoing in 2007/8. This gives 
Protherics one of the strongest pipelines in the sector relative to our 
size. Proof of concept is expected for many of these programmes 
over the next 12-24 months and delivering clinical results remains 
our biggest opportunity to create shareholder value in the near 
to mid term.

Critical care and cancer: our core focus
_0_PTH_ar07_front.indd   5 19/06/2007   14:54:54 Protherics PLC
Annual Report 2007 06
Our strategy is to build a pipeline of specialist 
critical care and cancer products with high medical 
value that we can sell in the US and Europe. CroFab , 
DigiFab  and Voraxaze  should provide us 
with opportunities to establish a sales and 
marketing capability.
...for sales and marketing
CroFab
TM
: crotalid envenomations
   CroFab
TM
 has captured more than half of 
the potential US$70-80 million p.a. market 
in the US*
DigiFab
TM
: digoxin overdose
   DigiFab  has gained more than a 70% share 
of the estimated US$25 million p.a. market 
in the US*
Voraxaze
TM
: adjunct to HDMTX therapy
   500 patients are candidates for Voraxaze
TM
 
under the assumed initial labelling in the US* 
   Compassionate use sales in the US and Europe
CroFab  and DigiFab 
In 2010, we regain the 
US marketing rights to 
our two FDA-approved 
critical care products, 
CroFab  and DigiFab , 
providing us with an 
opportunity to establish 
a critical care sales 
force in the US.
Voraxaze 
The potential launch 
of Voraxaze
TM
 in the US 
in 2009 will provide us 
with an opportunity to 
build a specialist sales 
and marketing 
capability in cancer.
