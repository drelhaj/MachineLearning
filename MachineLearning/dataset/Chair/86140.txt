Annual report and accounts 2008
Chairman's statement
2008 saw a new management team in 
place and the commencement of early 
commercial production in Syria.
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to report on a year 
of significant achievement and 
change at Gulfsands.
2008 was characterised by two 
developments in particular. 
The first has been the 
recruitment of a new Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, each of whom 
is now thoroughly settled in his 
new responsibilities in our 
recently established London 
head office. We are fortunate 
indeed to have secured the 
services of two such 
experienced individuals as Ric 
Malcolm and Andrew Rose.
The second was the bringing into 
early commercial production of 
the Khurbet East field in Syria 
during the third quarter. To 
achieve commercial levels of 
production within little more than  
a year of completing the initial 
discovery well is an impressive 
achievement for any oil and gas 
company, and great credit is due 
in particular to Mahdi Sajjad and 
our team in Syria as well as the 
Syrian Petroleum Company for 
the commitment and support they 
have given us. At the time of 
writing, gross production from 
Khurbet East is around 11,000 
barrels of oil per day (bopd ) 
which we intend to increase to up 
to 16,000 bopd by the year-end, 
as an interim step towards full 
commercial development of the 
Khurbet East and Yousefieh fields 
in late 2010.
Strong Financial Position
Against a backdrop of 
extraordinarily fraught global 
financial and economic 
circumstances, Gulfsands' 
financial strength is one of its 
principal attributes. 
At year end we had free cash 
balances of approximately $37 
million and no borrowings. That 
position remains essentially 
unchanged at the time of writing. 
Even in the recent environment 
of much reduced oil prices, our 
Syrian operations remain 
comfortably cash generative. 
In light of the continuing 
economic uncertainties, your 
Board feels it is important to 
focus in particular on the Group's 
ability to cope with downside  
scenarios. In this regard, it 
should be a comfort to 
shareholders that we could 
absorb still further significant oil 
price reductions and remain able 
to meet all our operating and 
corporate overheads, including 
the costs of developing our 
Khurbet East and Yousefieh 
fields, without recourse to 
additional external funding.
Restatement of Prior Year 
Accounts and Exceptional 
Charges
As part of a thorough review 
undertaken by the new Chief 
Financial Officer, the Board has 
decided that it is appropriate to 
restate the 2006 and 2007 
Financial Statements to reflect 
what we now consider to have 
been erroneous under-recording 
of estimated decommissioning 
liabilities and depreciation 
associated with the Group's Gulf 
of Mexico assets.
Additionally, the 2008 Income 
Statement reflects significant 
charges for compensation-related 
expenses. These charges are a 
consequence in part of severance 
costs and option grants related to 
the changes in senior management 
which took place during 2008, and 
in part of the re-grant of certain 
options which were unable to be 
exercised before their expiry at the 
end of 2007 due to restrictions on 
Directors' ability to deal in the 
Company's shares for the last 
several months of that year.
Finally, the 2008 Income 
Statement reflects a charge for 
loss on currency translation, 
brought about by the very 
sudden movement in the US 
Dollar/Sterling exchange rate in 
the latter part of 2008. As the 
Company now has significant 
Sterling-denominated overheads 
by virtue of migrating its central 
management function to London, 
it is appropriate to maintain 
significant Sterling balances and 
the loss on translation does not 
represent a cash outflow.
All these matters are dealt with in 
detail elsewhere in the Annual 
Report. My reason in drawing 
attention to them is merely to 
emphasise that, notwithstanding 
the rather severe impact on 
bottom line reported earnings, 
they have no impact on the 
Group's cash position or ability to 
generate positive cash flow and 
are entirely historic in their nature.

Chairman's statement continued
Syria
In the course of 2008 Gulfsands 
made a further significant 
discovery in Block 26 in the form 
of the Yousefieh field. This 
discovery, together with the 
adjacent Khurbet East field, is 
the subject of an aggressive 
appraisal and development 
campaign intended to define 
more precisely the oil-bearing 
characteristics of the two fields 
and to bring them both into full 
commercial development as 
early as possible. This remains 
our single highest priority.
Only slightly behind the 
development of the Khurbet East 
and Yousefieh Fields as a priority, 
and on a parallel track, we are 
proceeding apace to evaluate 
and exploit the remaining 
exploration opportunities within 
Block 26. A major programme of 
3D seismic acquisition is well 
under way. We continue to 
believe, based on all the 
evidence at our disposal, that the 
remaining potential of our block 
is tremendous.
It is an old adage that success 
breeds success. As a result of 
what the Group has been able to 
achieve to date in Block 26, and 
the political capital and credibility 
thereby accumulated, we are 
now in an excellent position to 
pursue further opportunities in 
Syria. In this regard, the timing  
of the current tentative 
rapprochement between Syria 
and the United States is 
propitious. We are determined  
to pursue the openings thereby 
presented to the full.
Iraq
Political circumstances in Iraq, 
although far from perfect, are 
more favourable to beginning to 
establish long term commercial 
operations than has been the 
case at any time since the 
invasion in 2003.
We have in recent months made 
significant progress in negotiations 
for the Maysan gas project. We 
are also involved in a number of 
discussions on other opportunities 
in Iraq which are of very 
considerable long term potential.
Your Board is cautiously 
optimistic that in the near future 
we will be in a position to 
announce positive developments 
bringing with them the prospect 
of handsome ultimate reward for 
the time and effort we have 
expended in Iraq over the past 
five years. At the same time we 
remain conscious of the 
considerable uncertainties that 
continue to overhang that 
country's future. We will only sign 
up to commitments which we are 
convinced are soundly based, 
within the Group's financial 
compass and which do not 
jeopardise the Group's ability to 
maximise the opportunities for 
value creation represented by 
our existing successful  
Syrian operations.
Gulf of Mexico Assets
The Group's Gulf of Mexico 
assets have played a key role in 
getting us to the position we now 
enjoy. Without the cash 
generated by these assets over 
the past few years we would not 
have been able to have achieved 
our exploration and development 
success in Syria.
The diminution in the continuing 
strategic importance of these 
assets to Gulfsands has 
coincided fortuitously with the 
recent drop in oil and gas prices 
and the global credit crisis, which 
factors have impacted severely 
both the operating profitability of 
our Gulf of Mexico business 
(particularly gas production) and 
the market for such assets. In 
addition, the severity of the 
hurricane season in 2008 once 
again shut in much of the 
Company's production for the 
second half of the year. 
Accordingly, our Gulf of Mexico 
business made a loss for the year.
Your Board takes an entirely 
pragmatic view of these assets. 
They are clearly no longer 
strategic to the Group. They are 
also unlikely for the foreseeable 
future, absent a meaningful 
strengthening in gas prices, to 
make much in the way of a 
positive contribution to profits 
and cash flow. At the same time, 
Gulfsands is under absolutely no 
pressure to sell these assets and 
this would be a bad time to try to 
do so. The assets continue to 
hold potential for the future. 
Accordingly, we will continue to 
selectively invest in them to the 
extent we deem appropriate, and 
to wait until market conditions for 
transactions in assets of this kind 
revert to some sort of normality.
Concluding Remarks
My fellow Directors and I are 
highly enthusiastic about the 
Group's prospects for 2009 and 
beyond. While we would certainly 
welcome a recovery in oil and 
gas prices, we are well-
positioned not only to survive but 
indeed to flourish in the absence 
of such a recovery for the 
foreseeable future. I look forward 
to reporting significant further 
progress in a year's time.
Yours sincerely,
Andrew West
