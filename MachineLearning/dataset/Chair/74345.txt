Chairman's Statement
during 2010 Fiberweb saw a 
continuation of sustained 
performance improvement in many 
areas. Financially, steady progress 
was delivered in sales and 
profitability, with strong returns to 
shareholders during the year. major 
investments in infrastructure in the 
USa, in product development and in 
productive assets were successfully 
undertaken during the year in 
several sites in Europe and at our 
major industrial site at Old Hickory 
in the USa. 
Fiberweb's portfolio was strengthened 
by the acquisition of Boddingtons 
announced in december, creating a 
stronger platform for the group in the 
geosynthetics market. From a 
management perspective, further 
streamlining and strengthening was 
accomplished, with costs further 
reduced and responsiveness improved, 
well-aligned with the evolving needs of 
our customers. additionally, important 
initiatives in the areas of management 
development, lean manufacturing and 
total quality management were 
developed and launched during the 
course of the year, demonstrating  
our ability to continue to invest in 
Fiberweb's human and infrastructure 
resources.
Fiberweb continues to position its 
businesses for top-line and bottom-
line growth and to broaden its product 
range to address the needs of 
customers in its core business areas.
Financial Results
Overall, the financial results for 2010 
are very encouraging. against a 
background of increasing raw 
material costs, the continuing severe 
recessions in many of the group's 
construction markets and the high 
degree of economic uncertainty 
prevailing for much of the year, 
continuing sales of  463.2 million 
(2009:  454.2 million) increased like-
for-like by  41.2 million (9.8%) at 
constant currency. This reflects 3.6% 
like-for-like volume growth, mix 
improvement aided by the launch of 
new products and the effect of higher 
raw material costs on sales prices. 
Continuing underlying operating profit 
of  29.0 million increased by 25.5% 
from  23.1 million, largely from the 
impact of higher sales, but also reduced 
overhead costs and the contribution 
from the strong performance of the 
first full-year of Fiberweb's 50% stake 
in the FitesaFiberweb joint venture. 
Underlying operating margin 
increased by 117 basis points to 6.3%, 
with the 6.6% achieved in the second 
half, representing the seventh 
consecutive half-year of improving 
margins.
Net cash flow from operating activities 
before non-recurring items cash cost 
was again strong at  44.6 million 
(2009:  59.3 million) as a result of 
improved margins. in recent years, 
reductions in working capital have 
contributed significantly to operating 
cash flow. in 2010, due to increases in 
raw material costs and significant 
sales growth, working capital 
increased slightly by  4.3 million but 
at 14.6% achieved the group target of 
15% of sales. Capital investment of 
 33.2 million (2009:  27.0 million) 
increased significantly to secure 
competitive manufacturing and 
product development infrastructure 
for the future. The return on invested 
capital
(1)
 of 8.8% (2009: 7.5%), while 
substantially improved, remains below 
Fiberweb's cost of capital, estimated 
at 9%, and further improvement 
remains a key objective. Net debt of 
d uring 2010 Fiberweb saw a continuation 
of sustained performance improvement in 
many areas. Financially, steady progress 
was delivered in sales and profitability, 
with strong returns to shareholders 
during the year.

 151.2 million (2009:  136.6 million) 
increased by  14.6 million due to 
higher capital investment, together 
with the  5.4 million cost of the 
termination of interest rate swaps 
relating to the old loan facility in 
July. On a constant currency basis, 
net debt increased by  12 million.
Key Events
important milestones during 2010 
included:
May -  
The successful 
upgrade of a large 
industrial spunbond 
line at Fiberweb's 
industrial manufacturing site in 
Berlin. This upgraded line then ran 
at full utilisation for the remainder 
of the year.
August - 
Completion and 
commissioning of the 
major new utilities plant 
at Old Hickory, giving 
Fiberweb's large industrial 
manufacturing operation on the site a 
secure and cost-effective source of 
steam and chilled water.
September - 
Completion of the 
building to house 
Fiberweb's new 
industrial product 
development facility at Old Hickory.
September -  
l aunch of Fiberweb 
xl , the group's first 
senior management 
development 
programme and of q5zero, the 
group's operational excellence 
programme.
November - 
Completion of the 
construction phase of 
FitesaFiberweb's 
spunbond facility at 
Simpsonville, USa and the beginning 
of commissioning.
December - 
announcement of the 
acquisition of the 
Boddingtons 
geosynthetics business, 
based at maldon in the UK. The 
acquisition was successfully 
completed on 6 January 2011.
The Hygiene business enjoyed a 
mixed year, with total volumes up 
only 2% like-for-like. Spunbond 
volumes were, in general, strong 
throughout the year, both at our 
wholly-owned facilities in Europe 
and at FitesaFiberweb's plants in the 
USa, mexico and Brazil. volumes of 
speciality carded fabrics were more 
volatile during the year. Excellent 
progress was made with several 
important multinational customers 
in delivering innovation, securing 
additional volumes and longer-term 
supply relationships. Our production 
lines continued to be well-utilised 
overall, but margins were impacted, 
especially in the first-half, by steadily 
increasing raw material prices and 
the one-quarter lag in price recovery 
as a result of the pass-through 
contracts typically in place with 
major customers. airlaid volumes 
in asia were volatile and progress in 
filling l ine 2 continues to be slower 
than expected.
The industrial businesses saw the 
strongest trading performance, 
with volumes increasing by 6.3% 
despite tough market conditions. 
The americas saw 10% volume 
Fiberweb continues to position its 
businesses for top-line and bottom-line 
growth and to broaden its product range 
to address the needs of customers in its 
core business areas.

Chairman's Statement continued
growth, with a solid performance 
in filtration and initial success in 
new roofing products. Our first half 
growth in the US housing markets 
was not maintained in the second 
half, reflecting a material weakening 
in confidence. European volumes 
increased by 5%, with industrial 
Specialities and agriculture markets 
strong. d espite seeing a major 
reduction in European geotextile 
demand as a result of the decline in 
public sector construction, Terram 
volumes grew 4.5%, gaining UK 
market share and maintaining strong 
export volumes. 
Dividends
The Board is pleased to maintain the 
final dividend at 2.5 pence per share, 
continuing the stable payout record 
established since demerger. The total 
2010 dividend of 4.2 pence per share 
represents 39% of earnings, with 
comfortable dividend cover of 2.6. 
The final dividend, if approved by 
shareholders, will be paid on 27 may 
2011 to shareholders on the register 
on 26 april 2011 and the shares will 
go ex-dividend on 20 april 2011.
The Board and Management
The Board has remained unchanged 
during the year.
There have been three changes 
in senior executive management 
during the year. alice Heezen 
joined in January 2010 as Head of 
HR and Change, replacing Bridget 
Bradshaw who left after five years at 
the heart of Fiberweb's turnaround 
programme. in July 2010 Carsten 
Heldmann was promoted to 
president of Consumer Fabrics, 
replacing ian Barnes who retired. 
Carsten had previously been 
Consumer Fabrics Head of R&d and 
marketing. derek Chan, president 
of Fiberweb asia, left in december 
2010 after four years, and his role 
has been incorporated into the 
responsibilities of other divisional 
presidents.
Prospects
Fiberweb is continuing to follow a 
consistent strategy of margin 
improvement through investment in 
competitive assets and 
manufacturing processes, 
investment in product development 
capabilities and through gaining a 
deeper understanding of key 
customers and markets. The like-
for-like sales growth and the 
continuing improvement in 
underlying operating margin seen 
throughout 2010, in difficult 
markets, is strong evidence that 
Fiberweb continues on the right 
track. Further acquisitions and 
innovations will be sought to 
accelerate Fiberweb's development 
in targeted markets, offering the 
potential for sustainably attractive 
returns through product and service 
differentiation.
