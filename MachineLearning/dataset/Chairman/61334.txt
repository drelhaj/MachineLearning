 RESULTS
I am pleased to report a record set of results for
the financial year 2002, a period marked by the
most challenging trading conditions in the
global IT industry for a long time. Group
turnover for the year to 30 June 2002 was up
7% to  149.5m (2001:  140.3m). Acquisitions
contributed 1% of turnover growth. Operating
profit before exceptional items amounted to
 9.2m (2001:  8.1m), an increase of 14%. 
Operating profit before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items increased by 14% to   11.3m
(2001:  9.9m). Profit before tax, goodwill amor-
tisation and exceptional items was  10.9m
(2001:  9.6m), up 13%. After tax and minority
interests basic earnings per share is calculated
at 3.5p (2001: 27.9p), down 87%. Adjusted
earnings per share, earnings being adjusted for
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items,
rose 10% to 36.9p (2001: 33.4p).
During the year the core EDC (Electronic
Document Capture) Division continued to bene-
fit from its position as the leading global
partner for EDC products and services with a
significant level of new contract gains. In the
face of very challenging global IT market condi-
tions EDC continued its growth record and
expanded its market position by new product
launches and additional partnership
agreements.
The SGA (Samsung General Agency) Division
experienced declining turnover rates in difficult
trading conditions, but maintained an
acceptable, albeit lower, level of operating profit
contribution.
FINANCIAL POSITION
Due to its cash generative business model the
Group generated cash flow from operations of
 14.0m (2001:  8.4m) and ended the year with
net funds of  3.8m (net debt of  0.7m at 30
June 2001). The Group spent  1.7m in cash on
acquisitions and other investments during the
year .
OPERATING REVIEW
The EDC Division is DICOM Group's largest
division, representing 82% of profits. It
develops and sells software and electronic
components, provides a broad range of EDC
services and distributes key related products to
over 1,000 system integrators and software
houses in more than 60 countries world-wide.
EDC solutions offer end users high returns on
investment by allowing data and document
intensive organisations to reduce business
transaction costs and improve their level of
customer service.
EDC achieved organic sales growth in local cur-
rency terms of 12%. Acquisitions contributed an
additional 1% in sales. In total, EDC contributed
68% (2001: 63%) of the Group's turnover in the
year to 30 June 2002. The provision of services
and sales of products developed by the Group
now account for 56% of EDC turnover (2001:
51%). The sale of complementary third party
products, primarily high-speed document
scanners, accounted for 44% (2001: 49%).

CHAIRMAN' S
S TA TEMENT The EDC Division contributed  9.3m (2001:
 7 .0m) operating profit, an increase of 33%.
This represents 82% of DICOM Group's total
operating profit before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items. During the year EDC also
launched a number of new products and
entered new partnership arrangements, which
will enable the Group to address new areas of
the EDC market.
The SGA Division continued to experience
difficult trading conditions, particularly in
Austria. Turnover fell by 8% to  47.5m (2001:
 51.5m), but SGA contributed 18% of DICOM
Group's total operating profit before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items.
EXCEPTIONAL CHARGES
As previously announced DICOM Group has
incurred certain costs during the year, which
have been treated as exceptional charges.
Following the default on 1 April 2002 of a
scheduled consideration payment DICOM Group
has reviewed its overall exposure in relation to a
non-core investment disposed of in early 2000.
A provision of  4m (with no adverse future cash
flow implications) is considered necessary. This
sum is treated as an exceptional item. The
residual exposure is secured by 450,000
DICOM Group shares, currently held in escrow. 
DICOM Group had to write off a trade debt owed
by a US distributor, which discontinued business
activities in early December 2001, resulting in
an exceptional charge of  1.2m. 
DICOM Group's business prospects in the US
have not been materially adversely affected by
the discontinuance of the US distributor. DICOM
Group markets its products and services
through an extensive network of ISV's
(Independent Software Vendors) and resellers
and is therefore not overly dependent on any
specific distributor. DICOM Group has appointed
four distributors in the US and has authorised
more than 1,000 resellers worldwide to
integrate and market its products. 
MANAGEMENT CHANGES 
We announced in late 2001 that after 11 very
happy years as CEO of DICOM Group I would be
retiring with effect from 1 July 2002 to take up
the post of Non-executive Chairman. I want to
take this opportunity to thank all our
employees, business partners and shareholders
for their outstanding contribution in building
DICOM Group into a great company.
The Group Board has committed significant
resources into the planning of our  management
succession. We are very pleased to have elected
Arnold von B ren to succeed me as CEO from 1
July 2002. Arnold has been with the Group
since 1994 and recently managed the successful
integration of Kofax since February 2000.
Before that he was responsible for the Europe-
based EDC operations. Urs Niederberger was
promoted to the position of Chief Operating
Officer, while retaining his function as Group
Finance Director.
During the last two years a strong executive
team has been built up including the heads of
each of the principal business units and the
executive board members.
STAFF
Staff numbers grew from 718 to 773 during the
year, principally due to the acquisition of a
majority stake in DICOM Asia. DICOM Group's
future prosperity is in large measure dependent
on the ability, energy and loyalty of our staff,
whose specialist knowledge, training and

experience is key to the successful provision of
the Group's value-added services. Staff turnover
has remained at low levels and we continue to
attract high calibre people around the world. I
would like to record my personal appreciation to
all staff for their commitment and contribution
during the year.
DIVIDEND
The Directors propose the payment of a final
dividend of 2.8p per ordinary share, to be paid
on 29 November 2002 to those shareholders on
the register as at 1 November 2002, which when
added to the interim dividend of 1.4p per
ordinary share, makes a recommended total
dividend for the year of 4.2p per ordinary share
(2001: 3.66p). This represents an increase of
15% over the previous year.
ACQUISITIONS
On 27 June 2002 DICOM Group announced it
had increased its holding in DICOM Asia
Holdings Pte Ltd from 40% to 80% by
purchasing the balance from local management.
The consideration paid was S$2.4m ( 0.9m) in
cash. The local management team, who will
continue to run the Asian operation, holds the
remaining 20%. DICOM Asia, founded in 1996, is
headquartered in Singapore and active in 10
countries throughout Asia and Australia. Its
subsidiaries in Malaysia, the Philippines,
Indonesia and in Australia are the EDC market
leaders in their respective territories. Recently
DICOM Asia also expanded into new growth
markets in the Greater China region with sales
outlets in Hong Kong, Taipei and Beijing.
On 13 September 2002, DICOM Group increased
the holding in PDS S.r .l., its principal EDC sales
organisation in Italy, from 60% to 100% by
purchasing the balance from local management.
The purchase price consisted of E4.3m ( 2.7m)
payable in cash on completion and a deferred
consideration of up to E1.9m ( 1.2m), dependent
on performance over the financial years 2003-
2005.
LISTING INFORMATION
In January 2002 DICOM Group became a
constituent of the techMARK100 index,
comprising the 100 largest UK technology
companies on the London Stock Exchange. In
July 2002 DICOM Group applied for a de-listing
from the Neuer Markt segment of the Deutsche
B rse in Frankfurt, while retaining its listing on
the main board (Geregelter Markt ). These
changes became effective on 1 August 2002. On
19 August 2002 it was announced that DICOM
Group was re-classified under the  Computer
Services' FTSE UK sub sector on the London
Stock Exchange.
APPOINTMENT OF NEW ADVISOR AND
BROKER
In April 2002 DICOM Group announced the
appointment of HSBC Investment Bank plc,
London, as its Financial Advisor and Corporate
Broker.
PROSPECTS
The Group is well positioned in its core EDC
market, which continues to show good growth
in contrast to the difficult general trading
conditions in the IT market. We are excited by
recent product launches and partnership
agreements that will support our expansion into
segments of the EDC market not previously
covered by the Group. The EDC division's
current trading performance and good growth
prospects enable the Directors to view the
Group's outlook with optimism.
