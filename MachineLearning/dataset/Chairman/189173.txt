 Directors' Report - Strategic Report
04 Chairman's Statement
I was absolutely delighted to  
join the Board of STV in 2013  
and to succeed Richard Findlay 
as Chairman. Growing up in 
Scotland in the 1960s, STV  
was an important part of my  
life and so it is a great privilege 
for me to join the company, 
particularly at such an important 
time for the company and  
for Scotland.
Since June, I have observed an 
organisation that is focused on its 
consumer relationships, commercially 
and results oriented with a strong 
clarity of purpose, objectives and 
targets and driven by a powerful 
creative energy at its heart.
Across the company there is a palpable 
sense of pride in the brand and the 
strength of connections held with 
consumers and commercial partners. 
Combined with a clear strategy to 
embrace the opportunities presented 
by a changing media landscape,  
I am assured of the potential of the 
company to realise its ambitions. 
In particular, I am confident the 
company is well positioned to achieve 
its strategic aim of one-third of 
earnings being derived from  
non-broadcast activities by 2015.  
The strategy to deliver this, through 
growth of the digital business and 
STV Productions, combined with 
continuing to build a strong core 
business founded on the deep 
connections held with consumers 
across an increasing range of 
platforms, is ambitious and focused 
and provides a clear plan to deliver 
future growth and value creation. 
The recent conclusion of the licence 
renewal process for the maximum 
term of 10 years, provides certainty 
and a stable backdrop to enable 
continued investment and focus to  
be placed upon new growth activities, 
enabling the transformation of STV  
to continue.
A year of significant progress 
During 2013 the company has been 
successful in further consolidating  
its leading position in Scotland 
through the introduction of new 
ground breaking digital consumer 
services, whilst continuing to deliver 
an outstanding quality of public 
service content. The success 
achieved by STV Productions has 
successfully enhanced its reputation 
as a leading UK production company 
with growing international 
connections.
STV holds a unique and ubiquitous 
connection with communities across 
Scotland. In addition to serving 
communities with high quality, 
trusted, informative and entertaining 
content, new connections are being 
formed through seeking to enhance 
the lives of the most vulnerable 
children in these communities 
founded upon a strong commitment 
to social investment, with over  2.5m 
raised by the STV Appeal during the 
2013 campaign.
Financial performance
Good progress has been made 
during 2013 in continuing to diversify 
the structure and revenue base of  
the business with non-broadcast 
activities now accounting for almost 
20% of earnings. This has been 
achieved through further strong 
performance in digital activities  
and growth momentum in STV 
Productions arising from a raft of new 
commissions and achievement of the 
key priority of securing commissions 
of returning long-running series for 
major broadcasters.
The balance sheet has further 
strengthened as net debt has 
continued to reduce, down 21%  
at  35.7m (2012:  45.3m), a reduction  
of 34% over the past two years.  
The company remains on track to 
achieve the target of a ratio of net 
debt to EBITDA of one and a half 
times by the end of 2014.
Profit before tax, IAS19 and exceptional 
items is  15.2m, up 16% on last year, 
and earnings per share on the same 
basis are up 13% at 34.4p.
The underlying profitability of all areas 
of the business continues to perform 
strongly, with improving margin 
performance in growth activities. 
Digital margins increased significantly 
to 40%, up from 26% the previous 
year. Margins also improved in  
STV Productions. 
The consumer business delivered  
a margin of 17.8% (2012: 18.3%)  
  ... continued strength in the overall 
financial position ... pleased to confirm 
the return to dividend payments.'

STV Annual Report & Accounts 2013
down slightly as a result of higher 
network programme costs. Overall, 
Group operating profit has increased 
for the third consecutive year, up  
5% at  18.0m (2012:  17.1m).
Signs of some improvement in the 
macro economy have been reflected 
through a modest upturn in consumer 
confidence, resulting in an increase  
in national airtime revenues. These 
performed in line with expectations, 
outperforming the market, and  
up 6% at  71.3m (2012:  67.4m).  
The Scottish airtime advertising 
market continues to stabilise with 
performance flat year on year at 
 13.1m (2012:  13.1m).
The company has a strong culture  
of cost control and a relentless focus 
on operational efficiency balanced 
with a thriving creative energy. This 
focus on delivery of commitments is 
demonstrated through the pursuit of 
achievement of the 11 KPIs. The KPIs 
have been reviewed for 2014 and 
beyond and will include increased 
visibility with metrics for consumer 
engagement and reach by platform, 
reflecting the multi-platform nature  
of the business.
Dividend
As a result of the continued strength 
in the overall financial position of the 
Group, the strength of the balance 
sheet, and delivery of a strong 
operational and financial performance, 
I am pleased to confirm the return  
to dividend payments. 
The Board will recommend the 
payment of a full-year dividend of  
2.0 pence per share in respect  
of 2013. Subject to shareholder 
approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, the dividend will be paid  
on 23 May 2014.
I am committed to the introduction  
of creating sustainable value and 
through a progressive dividend  
policy, delivering capital return for 
shareholders in the long term.
Positive growth momentum 
across all areas of the business
STV Productions has successfully 
increased the number of new 
commissions secured during the year 
including further commissions of 
long-running returning series. As the 
profile of the business develops in the 
UK and internationally with content of 
the highest quality being developed 
and produced across genres; the 
business is now a multi-genre creative 
force, well positioned for growth in 
2014 with a strong delivery schedule 
and pipeline for new commissions  
to be secured.
The success achieved over the  
past year by the news and current 
affairs team has confirmed STV as  
the leading media provider for 
coverage of the campaign on the 
referendum for Scottish independence 
which will take place in September. 
This coverage will continue in 2014  
with further leaders' debates along 
with an extensive programme of 
features and coverage delivered 
through STV News and Scotland 
Tonight, online coverage and  
social media.
Additionally, a partnership with 
Debating Matters to provide the 
opportunity for secondary school 
pupils from every local authority area 
in Scotland to debate the big issues  
in the run up to the referendum on 
Scottish Independence in 2014, has 
been a great success in engaging 
young people in current affairs and 
strengthening connections with 
consumers of the future.
 
One of STV's key differentiators is  
the ability to operate at both a national 
and local level and the introduction  
of the City TV services in 2014  
will augment the local relevance of  
the brand and play a pivotal role in 
fulfilling the aim of super serving 
communities across Scotland.
Creating new prospects  
for future growth
2014 will be an historic year with the 
eyes of the world on Scotland and 
STV is in a prime position to deliver 
against this opportunity. This will 
present new and positive challenges 
for the news and current affairs team 
and provide an exceptional opportunity  
for the commercial team to increase 
market share.
The launch of the first of the City TV 
services will further strengthen the 
relationship with consumers as a new 
channel is added to the STV portfolio. 
This will build on the strong progress 
made during 2013 through the launch 
of the digital City services. 
The pace of change and opportunity 
facing STV in 2014 will both continue 
to increase as the expectations of 
consumers grow and, with a strong 
culture at the core of the business 
founded on employee values to  
be bold, stand together and strive  
to surprise, the company is well 
positioned to realise these 
opportunities and deliver further 
success in the year ahead.
The forthcoming year will be an 
exciting one for everyone associated 
with STV and the company is in a 
strong position to deliver further growth 
and value from that opportunity.
On behalf of your Board, I would like 
to thank our highly committed and 
talented staff and leadership team  
for their exceptional contribution 
during 2013 and thank shareholders 
for their support during a formative 
and successful year for the company.
I would finally like to express the 
Board's thanks to my predecessor 
Richard Finlay and Vasa Babic, who  
is retiring from the Board at the AGM, 
after seven years of very dedicated 
service. We have benefited greatly 
from their wise counsel.
