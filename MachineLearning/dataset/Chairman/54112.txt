 02    Croda Annual Report & Accounts 2013
In another year of demanding market conditions, Croda continued its track 
record of pre-tax profit and earnings per share growth. From a strategic 
perspective, we have made real progress, maintaining our focus on innovation 
and developing our business in both existing and emerging markets.
Chairman's Statement
Martin Flower, Chairman
With record sales of New and Protected Products (NPP) across the 
business, acquisitions in North America and China, three more R&D 
laboratories, two more customer training centres and further investment  
in our global sales force, our platform for sustainable, organic growth  
is much stronger. 
Full Year Results 
Despite 2013 seeing little change to the demanding market environment 
that we experienced throughout 2012, Croda continued to make further 
progress with sales, margins and profits reaching record levels.  
T urnover from continuing operations increased by 2.4% to  1,077.0m  
(2012:  1,051.9m). Adjusted operating profit
1
 grew by 3.7% to  264.6m 
(2012:  255.1m) and we saw Group return on sales on the same basis 
increase to 24.6% (2012: 24.3%). The sales performance was mixed with 
strong growth seen in NPP , slower growth in areas where we have less 
differentiation from our competitors and declines in commodity sales. Our 
ongoing success in being able to improve the quality of our business mix 
can be clearly seen in robust margins and the overall increase in 
profitability.
Adjusted pre-tax profit
1
 increased 5.4% to  251.4m (2012:  238.5m)  
and earnings per share on the same basis
1
 increased by 8.3% to 132.2p 
(2012: 122.1p), boosted by a lower tax charge. On an unadjusted basis, 
pre-tax profit increased 5.0% to  250.1m (2012:  238.3m) and earnings per 
share from continuing operations improved by 7.6% to 131.2p (2012: 121.9p).
Sector Performance  
Consumer Care sales increased by 1.2% over the year to  593.2m  
(2012:  586.4m) with good growth in Western Europe being the highlight 
and weak trading in EEMEA* together with adverse currency translation in 
Asia being the major negatives. Health Care had the highest increase in 
turnover. We saw marginal growth in Personal Care whilst in Crop Care, 
sales for the year as a whole were flat versus 2012 but were much stronger 
in the second half, reversing the declines seen at the interim stage. Overall, 
higher margin NPP sales saw double-digit growth, a 3.2% rise in adjusted 
operating profit
1
 to  191.3m (2012:  185.3m). The improving quality of our 
product mix helped increase return on sales to 32.2% (2012: 31.6%).
In Performance T echnologies, sales rose by 1.1% to  387.1m  
(2012:  382.8m) with a very strong performance in Asia eroded by  
declines in EEMEA* and Europe. Again we achieved double-digit NPP 
growth, supporting an adjusted operating profit
1
 increase of 5.9% to 
 63.0m (2012:  59.5m). Return on sales improved to 16.3% (2012: 15.5%), 
representing further progress towards our medium term target of 20%. All 
business areas apart from Coatings & Polymers achieved sales growth.
The acquisition of Sichuan Sipo Chemical Co. Ltd ( Sipo') was the main 
reason behind Industrial Chemicals' 16.9% sales increase to  96.7m  
(2012:  82.7m). As expected, Sipo made only a small contribution to profit 
in the second half, and adjusted operating profit
1
 for the year was flat at 
 10.3m (2012:  10.3m). Consequently, return on sales reduced to 10.7% 
(2012: 12.5%).
T urnover from operations increased from  1,051.9m to 
 1 ,077 .0m+2.4

Foundations for Sustainable Growth 
During 2013, we have placed significant emphasis on expanding our 
resources in two key strategic areas, both of which continue to set 
Croda apart from the competition and help us to increase customer 
trust and loyalty. 
The first is innovation which, whether in our ingredients, processes or 
the mindset of our people, has always been at the heart of Croda's 
business; we want customers to partner with us because they value our 
innovation. In 2013, we have made significant progress to enhance our 
offering by both developing our own technologies and successfully 
acquiring new technology. We are in an strong position to generate 
future growth through innovation. 
The second is bringing our business closer to our customers, both in 
terms of understanding their needs and how we position our sites 
globally. Increasingly, this has meant focusing on the emerging markets 
of Asia, Latin America and EEMEA*. We have made significant progress 
expanding our business in all these markets, increasing our operational 
capability in terms of new and expanded R&D facilities, sales and 
customer training centres and manufacturing sites. We have also 
continued to recruit and retain people with excellent commercial and 
technical expertise. All of this will allow us to achieve faster growth in 
these emerging markets in the future.
Acquisitions  
During 2013 we acquired a 65% share in Chinese speciality chemicals 
manufacturer Sipo for  30.3m. Sipo has brought with it new 
technology within an excellent facility, and moved us closer to our 
customers in this key territory, strengthening our existing operations 
and overall position in Asia. We also acquired, for  7.8m, the global 
Specialty Chemicals business of Florida-based Arizona Chemical and 
with it world-leading technology that enhances our leadership in 
speciality ingredients from renewable resources. We look forward to 
generating value from the combination of these exciting new 
businesses and Croda's established global sales and marketing 
network. 
Sustainability  
Customers and consumers are putting an ever-greater value on 
sustainability, which means there is a strong commercial justification 
for our long-established commitment to increasing our sustainability 
credentials in every area of our business. We were delighted to be 
listed as one of the top Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in 
the World for a second consecutive year. This result is testament to 
Croda's performance to sustainability and the central role it plays in the 
Group's growth strategy. We are proud of our commitment in this area 
and it has brought us new business, illustrating how our strategy is 
good for growth as well as for the environment.
Board Appointments  
In January 2014, we announced the appointment of Dr Helena 
Ganczakowski as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 February 2014. 
Helena spent 23 years at Unilever and brings with her a wealth of 
experience in consumer marketing and innovative product development. 
We are delighted to welcome her to the Croda Board. Stanley 
Musesengwa will retire from the Board on 24 April 2014 following the AGM 
after seven years as a Non-Executive Director, at which point Steve Williams 
will take over as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. We wish 
Stanley well and thank him for the valuable role he has played over the last 
seven years.
Dividend  
We continue to be a highly cash generative business. This has allowed us  
to maintain our progressive dividend policy whilst also funding the 
significant investment and operational needs of the business. Effective 
management of these cash flows has led to net debt reducing slightly over 
the course of the year, despite spending  38.1m on acquisitions and over 
 40m of pension deficit funding. In line with our dividend policy, we 
propose a final dividend of 35.5p making the total dividend payable in 
respect of 2013 64.5p, an increase of 8.4% in line with the underlying 
growth in earnings per share.
Outlook 
While the current year has started in line with our expectations, global 
trends are unpredictable and our forward visibility remains limited. 
Currency translation is expected to have an adverse impact on profit 
growth in 2014. If last year's results had been translated using closing rates 
as at December 2013, pre-tax profits for 2013 would have been 
approximately  9m lower. However, we still expect to achieve constant 
currency sales and profit growth in 2014 characterised by:
   Improvement in margins in Performance T echnologies, progressing 
towards our target of 20% return on sales
   NPP sales growth
   Strong cash generation
The Board is confident that Croda has the right strategy in place to deliver 
our medium term growth targets.
