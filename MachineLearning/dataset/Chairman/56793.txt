 The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2005

As already mentioned in the Interim Statement, the past year has been
one of significant change for the group. With the sale of Elliott in May,
we have completed our reorganisation into a focused European textiles
maintenance business with strong market positions on the Continent
and in the UK. At the same time, we announced the return of 
 151 million of capital to shareholders, which was effected in August. 
In June, we refinanced our bank facilities on substantially better terms
and conditions and extended them to 2012.
There have also been key changes at board level, with Roger Dye and 
I moving respectively to Chief Executive and Chairman in May and 
Kevin Quinn joining us as Finance Director from Amersham in May. 
We are supported by a strong team of non-executives in Philip Rogerson,
John Burns and Per Utnegaard.
The board has addressed the future strategy of the group. The markets 
in which we operate are mature and therefore relatively low growth. 
In order to increase our top-line growth, we are cautiously expanding 
the breadth of our activities within the textile maintenance sector, both
organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Our focus is on improving our service to customers without
compromising our strong operational and financial controls. Geographically, we are concentrating on Europe.
Results and dividend The UK market has continued to be very challenging this year, especially in the
second half. The Continental European business, on the other hand, has had another good year and coupled
with lower financing costs and a lower tax rate has resulted in a satisfactory set of results.
Revenue from continuing operations in the year was  661.7 million (2004:  651.5 million), an increase of
2%. Operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and amortisation of customer
contracts (adjusted operating profit) was  91.7 million compared with  91.0 million last year, an increase of
1%. With the benefit of the substantial reduction in the net interest charge from  13.3 million to  7.2 million
and a lower effective tax rate of 28.8% for our continuing businesses (2004: 30.3 %), adjusted earnings
per share rose from 26.5 pence to 31.7 pence, an increase of 20%. 
In 2005 we implemented a significant restructuring programme in Germany and we have recognised a
charge of  7.1 million for the cost of this restructuring. We also received cash in the year of  5.0 million
owed to our Berendsen subsidiaries on asset sales prior to our acquiring the business in 2002. These items,
together with a profit on property sales of  0.3 million, are shown as exceptional items. Amortisation of
acquired customer contracts amounted to  2.0 million and operating profit after exceptional items and
amortisation of customer contracts was  87.9 million (2004:  94.4 million). 
Earnings per share, including the discontinued operations of Elliott and its profit on sale and the exceptional
items, were 66.8 pence compared to 23.3 pence in 2004. The net proceeds of the sale of Elliott amounted to
 160.4 million and in August 2005 we returned  144.4 million to shareholders by way of a B share scheme.
We announced on 24th February 2006 that we will redeem all remaining B shares for a further  6.5 million
on 2nd May 2006. In addition, we made a contribution of  23 million into the UK pension fund to cover the
past service liabilities of Elliott and HSS staff. 
The board is recommending a final dividend of 11.80 pence, which together with the interim dividend of 
5.50 pence paid in October 2005, gives a total of 17.30 pence, an increase of 5% on last
year. The total dividend is covered just under two times by the adjusted earnings per share,
taking into account the contribution of the Elliott business prior to disposal of 33.10 pence.
Free cash flow generated was  64.6 million,  62.8 million for our continuing business, 
which is  3.4 million above 2004. The group ended the year with net debt of  214.2 million
compared with  250.5 million at 31st December 2004 and with gearing of 57%, the same
as last year .
Development In 2005 we completed our strategy of disposing of the non-core
businesses. Following the sale of HSS Hire Service Group, completed in January 2004, this
year we completed the sale of Elliott Group Limited (Elliott) to a management buy-out
vehicle backed by TDR Capital for  166 million. Profit on the sale of the Elliott business
net of transaction expenses, was  68.0 million. We now have a focused European textile
maintenance business with leading market positions in most of the countries in which
we operate.
In Continental Europe we continued our focus on margin enhancement with cost control
and operating efficiency gains, further improving margins from 14.5% last year to 15.7%
this year. We have positioned ourselves for future growth by investing in our sales forces
and by broadening our service offering in our existing markets. We have also continued to
make targeted acquisitions, which expand our market reach, making acquisitions and
acquiring contracts in a number of countries, including Germany, where we acquired the
healthcare contracts of Rentokil Initial in the North and East of the country. Although
revenue growth has been difficult in most of our markets in Continental Europe, we are
looking for opportunities to grow profitably while at the same time driving efficiency.

Within the Sunlight business, our strategy has been to secure increased volumes and improved operating
efficiency and we have rationalised our operating base in response to market conditions. Management' s 
focus is on working with our customers to improve our service offering and to ensure that pricing reflects 
the cost of delivering that service, particularly in the light of the significant increases in wage and energy 
costs of our business. Rentokil' s withdrawal from UK textiles, announced in January 2006, should result in
some opportunities for us over time. We continued with our two year IT investment programme to provide
integrated systems to support operations, customer relationships and business development and we will 
make further investments to help drive operating efficiency, particularly in our healthcare plants.
Return of capital to shareholders Following the sale of Elliott, the extraordinary general meeting on 
15th August 2005 approved the board' s proposals to return  151 million of capital to shareholders with a 
5 for 6 share consolidation. In 2005, we repaid  144.4 million to shareholders and have announced to the
remaining B shareholders our intention to repay the remaining  6.5 million on 2nd May 2006.
Other financial matters We have made cash transfers of  23.0 million to the principal Davis UK pension
fund in respect of past service liabilities of Elliott and HSS staff. Our post tax deficit on pensions for the
group at 31st December 2005 was  57.2 million compared with  71.2 million last year. We continue to see
reduction of the pension liability as a priority and therefore intend to contribute at least  5 million annually 
for the next five years to the UK fund, with the aim of funding the past service deficit. 
In June 2005, the group concluded the refinancing of its banking facilities by signing a  420 million revolving
credit facility with an initial term of five years with eight banks on attractive commercial terms, including 
a reduced margin compared to the previous agreement. The group ended the year with net debt of 
 214.2 million compared with  250.5 million at 31st December 2004. 
Board and management This is my first Annual Report to shareholders as Chairman of the board, 
having succeeded Neil Benson following his retirement at the end of April 2005. Roger Dye succeeded 
John Ivey as Chief Executive and Kevin Quinn was appointed as Finance Director following Roger' s
appointment. We have made a number of changes in our board committees with Philip Rogerson taking 
over Chairmanship of the audit committee and Per Utnegaard the Chairmanship of the remuneration
committee. I chair the nomination committee and Philip has been appointed the senior independent 
director. John Burns continues to serve as non-executive director and the board benefits significantly from
his experience with the group.
Since January 2005 the Berendsen business in Continental Europe has been managed by Christer Str m
(Managing Director). He and his management team have delivered a strong result for the year and are well
placed to take this business forward in line with the group' s strategy. In the UK, Steve Finch (Managing
Director) and his experienced team have continued to restructure and innovate against the challenges they
face in the UK market. 
We have nearly 15,000 employees in the UK, Ireland and in Continental Europe, and the expertise and
dedication at all levels have been vital in ensuring that we retain the commitment to service delivery across 
the organisation that is so valued by our customers. On your behalf, and on behalf of the board, I thank 
them all for their individual contributions. The commitment this year of all our employees, management 
and staff alike, has been tremendous.
Outlook In the year ahead, the UK will remain challenging, especially in the short-term.
On Continental Europe, we are targeting further good progress in 2006, while continuing
to pursue acquisition opportunities. Overall we expect to deliver a satisfactory outcome 
for 2006.
