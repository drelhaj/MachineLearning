Schedule of meetings
The Audit Committee met three times during the year.Two of these meetings were part of the regular schedule of meetings set
out in the Committee's terms of reference.
Audit Committee meetings have formal agendas,which cover all of the areas of responsibility set out in the Committee's terms of
reference.These agendas include meetings with the external auditors without Executive Directors or managers of the Company present.
Appointment of external auditors
The Audit Committee recommended, and shareholders approved at the Group's AGM on 22 January 2007, the re-appointment
of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Group's external auditors. In accordance with Section 385 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution
proposing that Deloitte & Touche LLP be reappointed as auditors of the Company will be proposed at the next AGM.
Internal audit
TheAudit Committee has approved the appointment of RM's Group Reporting Manager,EdwardWarwick MEng,ACA,as Head of
InternalAudit.TheAudit Committee,with the advice and support of the Head of InternalAudit,sets an internal audit plan.The Head
of InternalAudit reports on progress against this plan at Audit Committee meetings.
During the year,the Group engaged KPMG LLP to advise it on internal audit matters and to perform review work on certain subsidiaries'
accounting and financial controls.Their report has been reviewed by the Committee, together with reports which were prepared
by RM finance personnel working under the direction of the Head of Internal Audit in accordance with the internal audit plan.
Policy on non-audit work
The Audit Committee has considered the issue of the provision of non-audit work by the external auditors and, in March 2003, agreed
a policy intended to ensure that the objectivity of the external auditors is not compromised.The policy states that non-audit work
should only be undertaken by the external auditors where there is a clear commercial benefit of doing so; any significant activity
must be approved, in advance, by at least two Audit Committee Members.
In practice, this policy has resulted in a steady reduction in non-audit work undertaken by the Group's external auditors. In 2007,
no non-audit was undertaken by the Group's external auditors.
Internal control
The Combined Code requires the Directors to review, at least annually, the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control,
and to report to shareholders that they have done so.The Audit Committee provides the information required by the Board to do
this.The Board attaches considerable importance to the Group's systems of internal control and risk management and confirms
that, throughout the period covered by these accounts and up to the date of their approval, it has regularly reviewed these areas
in accordance with the Turnbull guidance.
The Board and the Audit Committee reviews annually the process of risk management and internal control within the Group.The Board
carries out an analysis to identify the major risks that affect the Group and the impact of those risks and considers how those risks are
managed.The Group has appointed a Group Risk Manager, who leads this work and has continued to develop the Group's approach
towards risk management, which includes taking action to avoid or mitigate the impact of each risk.
The Board recognises that exposure to risk is an inherent part of creating value.The Group's internal controls are designed to
meet the particular requirements of the Group and address the risks to which it is exposed. In this context, the controls can provide
reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.The internal controls are designed to manage rather
than eliminate risk.

The processes to identify, assess and manage the risks to the Group's continued success are an integral part of the system of internal
control.These processes include systems to assess operational risks, linkage with the business planning process, monthly forecasting,
appointment of senior managers and controls over capital expenditure.The process of enhancing and improving these processes
ensures that business risks and opportunities are effectively managed. Principal risks are identified in the statement of risks section
within this report.
Principal risks are formally assessed by the Board during the annual planning process and steps are taken following this process
to ensure that these risks are monitored and managed.The Board delegates responsibility for operational risks to the CEO and the
Executive Committee, who review the effectiveness of internal controls over such risks on a regular basis.
The key features of the internal control system that operated throughout the period covered by the accounts are described below.
Control environment - The Board has put in place an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation
of authority to executive management. Individuals are formally made aware of their level of authority and their budgetary responsibility,
which enables them to identify and monitor financial performance.There are established policies and procedures, which are subject to
regular review.The Boards of the operating companies work within strict terms of reference and any matters outside those terms or the
agreed business plan are referred to the full Board for approval.The Group's selection and recruitment procedures are set to exacting
criteria and the performance management process is supportive of these same criteria.
Identification and evaluation of business risks and control objectives - The Board has the primary responsibility for identifying the
principal business risks facing the Group and developing appropriate policies to manage those risks.The Executive Committee meets
weekly with an agenda of specific operational measures for review.
Information systems - Executive managers are required to produce a business plan for approval at the beginning of each financial year
and detailed financial forecasts are formally compiled quarterly and reviewed by the Board. Consolidated management accounts are
produced each month and results measured against plan and previous year to identify any significant variations.
Main control procedures - The financial systems and procedures established lead the Board to a high level of confidence in the
completeness and accuracy of financial transactions.The well-established processes in place and the level of analytical detail given
within the management accounts facilitate the identification of unreliable data.The Group's treasury function operates within a defined
policy designed to control the Group's cash and to minimise its exposure to foreign exchange risk.
Monitoring - The Board has an established Audit Committee that meets periodically to review reports from management and the
external auditors so as to derive reasonable assurance on behalf of the Board that financial control procedures are in place and operate
effectively.An internal audit function reports directly to the Audit Committee and has annual plans agreed by the Audit Committee.
 Whistle blowing' policy
The Group has adopted a formal  whistle blowing' policy, which allows staff to raise concerns about possible improprieties. No concerns
were raised during the year.
Statement of risks
As with any business, RM is exposed to risks to the continued success of the business.As described above, the Group has put in place
processes designed to identify these principal risks and to manage and mitigate the effect of them.The Audit Committee is responsible
for ensuring that risks are properly considered and the Board is responsible for deciding what risks should be taken and how best
to manage and mitigate against the risks.
A review of the most significant risks the Group is exposed to is given in the Business Review on pages 18 to 19 of this Report.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the Group's risk management and internal control processes provide a high level of confidence
that the Executive Committee has identified and addressed the principal risks affecting RM.
